= FOR_MAX()


## Overview

`FOR_MAX()` function is used to search for a maximum in a specific column and return a value related to that maximum from another column.

## Syntax

[source,sql]
----
FOR_MAX(metric, value)
----


## Arguments

* `metric`: must be one of the following data types: `INT`, `LONG`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`, `DATE` or `TIMESTAMP`
* `value`: can be any data type except `TEXT`

The `FOR_MAX()` function returns `NULL` in the following situations:

* There are no input rows
* The `metric` column contains only `NULL` values
* The `value` corresponding to the metric maximum value is `NULL`

This function also returns `NaN` (not-a-number) if the input contains a `NaN`.

## Examples

For the needs of this section, we will use a `payment` table that stores customer payment records, including any applied discounts:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE payments (
    paymentid int,
    customer_name text,
    price real,
    discount real
);
INSERT INTO payments (paymentid, customer_name, price, discount)
VALUES 
(1, 'Alex', 280.12, 0.1),
(2, NULL, 35.75, NULL),
(3, 'Alex', 45.1, 0.05),
(4, 'Alex', NULL, 0.4),
(5, 'John', NULL, 0.1),
(6, 'Bob', 50.45, 0.07),
(7, 'Bob', 120.5, 0.0);
----


To view the `payments` table content, run the following query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM payments;
----


[cols="1,1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
|paymentid |customer_name |price |discount

|2 |35.75
|4 |Alex |0.4
|3 |Alex |45.1 |0.05
|1 |Alex |280.12 |0.1
|6 |Bob |50.45 |0.07
|5 |John |0.1
|7 |Bob |120.5 |0
|===



### `FOR_MAX()` basic usage

To determine the price, with which is associated the highest discount we need to run the following code:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT FOR_MAX(discount, price) AS for_lowest_discount
FROM payments;
----


This query returns the following output:

[cols="1",options="header"]
|===
|for_lowest_discount

|===



### `FOR_MAX()` with `GROUP BY` clause

In this example, we will use a `GROUP BY` clause to group customers and then utilise the `FOR_MAX()` function to get a discount for the highest price paid by each customer:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT customer_name, FOR_MAX(price, discount) AS discount
FROM payments
GROUP BY customer_name;
----


This query returns the following output:

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
|customer_name |discount

|Bob |0
|Alex |0.1
|John |0.1
|===
