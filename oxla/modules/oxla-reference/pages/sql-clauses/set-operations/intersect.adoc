= INTERSECT


## INTERSECT

### Overview

The `INTERSECT` combines the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements, retrieving only the common rows between them. Unlike `UNION`, which combines all rows and removes duplicates, `INTERSECT` focuses on returning rows that appear in all `SELECT` statements.

### Syntax

The syntax for the `INTERSECT` is as follows:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT value1, value2, ... value_n
FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT value1, value2, ... value_n
FROM table2;
----


The parameters from the syntax are explained below:

- `value1, value2, ... value_n`: The columns you want to retrieve. You can also use `SELECT * FROM` to retrieve all columns.
- `table1, table2`: The tables from which you wish to retrieve records.

[NOTE]
====
The data types of corresponding columns must be compatible.
====


### Example

Suppose you have two tables: `customers_old` and `customers_new`, containing customer data for different periods. You want to find the customers who are present in both tables:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE customers_old (
    customer_id INT,
    customer_name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE customers_new (
    customer_id INT,
    customer_name TEXT
);

INSERT INTO customers_old VALUES
(1, 'Alice'),
(2, 'Bob'),
(3, 'Charlie');

INSERT INTO customers_new VALUES
(2, 'Bob'),
(3, 'Charlie'),
(4, 'David');
----


Viewing the inserted values:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM customers_old;
SELECT * FROM customers_new;
----


[source,sql]
----
customer_id | customer_name
-------------+---------------
           1 | Alice
           2 | Bob
           3 | Charlie

 customer_id | customer_name
-------------+---------------
           2 | Bob
           3 | Charlie
           4 | David
----


Now, let’s combine common customers using the `INTERSECT`:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT customer_name FROM customers_old
INTERSECT
SELECT customer_name FROM customers_new;
----


The result will include only the names that appear in both tables:&#x20;

[source,sql]
----
customer_name
---------------
 Bob
 Charlie
----


The picture displays a list of customer names that appear in both tables. Only "Bob" and "Charlie" are found in both tables and shown as INTERSECT's final result.

## INTERSECT ALL

### Overview

The `INTERSECT ALL` retrieves all common rows between two or more tables, including duplicates.

This means that if a row appears multiple times in any of the `SELECT` statements, it will be included in the final result set multiple times.

### Syntax

The syntax for `INTERSECT ALL` is similar to `INTERSECT`:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT value1, value2, ... value_n
FROM tables
INTERSECT ALL
SELECT value1, value2, ... value_n
FROM tables;
----


The parameters from the syntax are explained below:

- `value1, value2, ... value_n`: The columns you wish to retrieve. You can also retrieve all the values using the `SELECT * FROM` query.
- `table1, table2`: The tables from which you want to retrieve records.

[NOTE]
====
The data types of corresponding columns in the `SELECT` queries must be compatible.
====


### Example

Let’s create three tables of products from different years. You want to find the common products among all three categories, including duplicates.

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE products_electronics2021 (
    product_id INT,
    product_name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE products_electronics2022 (
    product_id INT,
    product_name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE products_electronics2023 (
    product_id INT,
    product_name TEXT
);

INSERT INTO products_electronics2021 VALUES
(1, 'Laptop'),
(2, 'Phone'),
(3, 'Tablet'),
(4, 'Headphones');

INSERT INTO products_electronics2022 VALUES
(2, 'TV'),
(3, 'Printer'),
(4, 'Monitor'),
(5, 'Phone');

INSERT INTO products_electronics2023 VALUES
(3, 'Laptop'),
(4, 'Phone'),
(5, 'Oven'),
(6, 'AC');
----


Display the tables using the query below:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM products_electronics2021;
SELECT * FROM products_electronics2022;
SELECT * FROM products_electronics2023;
----


[source,sql]
----
product_id | product_name
------------+--------------
          1 | Laptop
          2 | Phone
          3 | Tablet
          4 | Headphones

 product_id | product_name
------------+--------------
          2 | TV
          3 | Printer
          4 | Monitor
          5 | Phone

 product_id | product_name
------------+--------------
          3 | Laptop
          4 | Phone
          5 | Oven
          6 | AC
----


Then, combine common products from all three categories using the `INTERSECT ALL`:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT product_name FROM products_electronics2021
INTERSECT ALL
SELECT product_name FROM products_electronics2022
INTERSECT ALL
SELECT product_name FROM products_electronics2023;
----


The result will include the products that are common among all three categories, including duplicates:

[source,sql]
----
product_name
--------------
 Phone
----


The illustration shows a list of product names common to all three years, including duplicates. In this case, the result is the product name "Phone," which appears across all three tables.
