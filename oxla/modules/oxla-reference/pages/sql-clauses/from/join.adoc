= JOIN


## Overview

`JOIN` clause is used to create a new table by combining records and using common fields between two tables in a database.

[TIP]
====
We support table aliasing used in the `JOIN` clause.

## Syntax

### Basic Syntax

The following is the syntax of the `JOIN` clause:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT table_1.column_1, table_2.column_2...
FROM table_1
JOIN table_2
ON table_1.common_field = table_2.common_field
----


. `SELECT table_1.column_1, table_2.column_2...` will select the columns to be displayed from both tables.
. `FROM table_1 JOIN table_2` represents the joined tables.
. `ON table_1.common_field = table_2.common_field` compares each row of table_1 with each row of table_2 to find all pairs of rows that meet the join-common field.
. When the join-common field is met, column values for each matched pair of rows from table_1 and table_2 are combined into a result row.

### Syntax with an Alias

You can use table aliasing to refer to the table’s name. An alias is a temporary name given to a table, column, or expression in a query.

The results will stay the same, but it can help you to write the query easier.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT left.column_1, right.column_2...
FROM table_1 as left
JOIN table_2 as right
ON left.common_field = right.common_field
----


## Examples

Before we move on, let us assume two tables:

**movies table**

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE movies (
  movie_id int,
  movie_name text,
  category_id int
);
INSERT INTO movies
    (movie_id, movie_name, category_id)
VALUES
    (201011, 'The Avengers', 181893),
    (200914, 'Avatar', 181894),
    (201029, 'Shutter Island', 181891),
    (201925, 'Tune in Your Love', 181892);
----


[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM movies;
----


It will create a table as shown below:

[source,sql]

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
|movie_id |movie_name |category_id

|201011 |The Avengers |181893
|200914 |Avatar |181894
|201029 |Shutter Island |181891
|201925 |Tune in Your Love |181892
|===



**categories table**

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE categories (
  id int,
  category_name text
);
INSERT INTO categories
    (id, category_name)
VALUES
    (181891, 'Psychological Thriller'),
    (181892, 'Romance'),
    (181893, 'Fantasy'),
    (181894, 'Science Fiction'),
    (181895, 'Action');
----


[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM categories;
----


It will create a table as shown below:

[source,sql]

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
|id |category_name

|181891 |Psychological Thriller
|181892 |Romance
|181893 |Fantasy
|181894 |Science Fiction
|181895 |Action
|===



---

. Based on the above tables, we can write a `JOIN` query as follows:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT a.movie_name, c.category_name
FROM movies AS a
JOIN categories AS c
ON a.category_id = c.id;
----


. The above query will give the following result:

[source,sql]

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
|movie_name |category_name

|Shutter Island |Psychological Thriller
|Tune in Your Love |Romance
|The Avengers |Fantasy
|Avatar |Science Fiction
|===



The JOIN checks each row of the **category_id** column in the first table (**movies**) with the value in the **id** column of each row in the second table (**categories**).

If the values are equal, it will create a new row that contains columns from both tables (**category_name)** and adds the new row **(movie_name)** to the result set.

Below is the Venn diagram based on the example:
