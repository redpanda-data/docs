= LEFT JOIN


## Overview

The `LEFT JOIN`returns **all** matching records from the left table combined with the right table. Even if there are no matching records in the right table, the `LEFT JOIN` will still return a row in the result, but with NULL in each column from the right table.

[NOTE]
====
`LEFT JOIN` is also known as `LEFT OUTER JOIN`.
====


## Syntax

[TIP]
====
We support table aliasing used in the `LEFT JOIN` clause.
====


### a) Basic Syntax

[source,sql]
----
SELECT column_1, column_2...
FROM table_1
LEFT JOIN table_2
ON table_1.matching_field = table_2.matching_field;
----


In the above syntax:

1.  `SELECT column_1, column_2...` defines the **columns** from both tables where we want the data to be selected.
2.  `FROM table_1` defines the **left table** as the main table in the FORM clause.
3.  `RIGHT JOIN table_2` defines the **right table** as the table the main table joins.
4.  `ON table_1.matching_field = table_2.matching_field` sets the join condition after the **ON** keyword with the matching field between the two tables.

### b) Syntax with an Alias

You can use an alias to refer to the table’s name. The results will stay the same. It only helps to write the query easier.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT A.column_1, B.column_2...
FROM table_1 A //table_1 as A
LEFT JOIN table_2 B //table_2 as B
ON A.matching_field = B.matching_field;
----


## Example

**item table**

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE item (
  item_no int NOT NULL,
  item_name text
);

INSERT INTO item
    (item_no,item_name)
VALUES
    (111,'Butter'),
    (113,'Tea'),
    (116,'Bread'),
    (119,'Coffee');
----


[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM item;
----


It will create a table as shown below:

[source,sql]

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
|item_no |item_name

|111 |Butter
|113 |Tea
|116 |Bread
|119 |Coffee
|===



**invoice table**

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE invoice (
  inv_no int NOT NULL,
  item int,
  sold_qty int,
  sold_price int
);

INSERT INTO invoice
    (inv_no, item, sold_qty, sold_price)
VALUES
    (020219,111,3,9000),
    (020220,116,6,30000),
    (020221,116,2,10000),
    (020222,116,1,5000),
    (020223,119,5,20000),
    (020224,119,4,16000);
----


[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM invoice;
----


It will create a table as shown below:

[source,sql]

[cols="1,1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
|inv_no |item |sold_qty |sold_price

|20219 |111 |3 |9000
|20220 |116 |6 |30000
|20221 |116 |2 |10000
|20222 |116 |1 |5000
|20223 |119 |5 |20000
|20224 |119 |4 |16000
|===



---

1\) Based on the above tables, we can write a `LEFT JOIN` query as follows:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT item_no, item_name, sold_qty, sold_price
FROM item
LEFT JOIN invoice
ON item.item_no = invoice.item;
----


- The **item** = left table, and the **invoice** = right table.

- Then it combines the values from the **item** table using the **item_no** and matches the records using the **item** column of each row from the **invoice** table.

- If the records are equal, a new row will be created with `item_no`, **`item_name`**, and `sold_qty`, `sold_price` columns as defined in the `SELECT` clause.

- **ELSE** it will create a new row with a `NULL` value from the right table **(invoice)**.

2\) The above query will give the following result:

[source,sql]

[cols="1,1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
|item_no |item_name |sold_qty |sold_price

|111 |Butter |3 |9000
|113 |Tea |null |null
|116 |Bread |6 |30000
|116 |Bread |2 |10000
|116 |Bread |1 |5000
|119 |Coffee |5 |20000
|119 |Coffee |4 |16000
|===



Based on the data from the **item** and **invoice** tables:

- The result matches the total item stored in the **item** table: **4 items.**
- The result will display all the item's data from the **left table (item table)**, even if there is 1 item that hasn’t been sold.
- The item id: `111` matches the item `butter` and has been sold for 3pcs/9000.
- The item id: `113` matches the item `tea` but has never been sold. Thus the sold_qty & sold_price columns are filled with: null.
- The item id: `116` matches the item `Bread` and has been sold three times, for 6pcs/3000, 2pcs/10000, and 1pc/5000.
- The item id: `119` matches the item `Coffee` and has been sold two times, for 5pcs/20000 and 4pcs/16000.

[TIP]
====
An **item** can have zero or many invoices. An **invoice** belongs to zero or one **item**.
