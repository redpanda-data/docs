= OUTER JOIN


## Overview

The `OUTER JOIN` **or** `FULL OUTER JOIN` returns all the records from the selected fields between the two tables (left table & right table) whether the join condition is met or not.

### **Inner Join vs. Outer Join**

The most significant difference between an `INNER JOIN` and an `OUTER JOIN` is that the `INNER JOIN` only returns the information from both tables which are common and related to each other. The OUTER JOIN will return all rows (matched/unmatched) from both tables.

[TIP]
====
We support table aliasing used in the OUTER JOIN clause.
====


## Syntax

### Basic Syntax

[source,sql]
----
SELECT column_1, column_2...
FROM table_1
FULL OUTER JOIN table_2
ON table_1.matching_field = table_2.matching_field;
----


In the above syntax:

. `SELECT column_1, column_2...` defines the **columns** from both tables where we want to display data.
. `FROM table_1` represents the **left table** with table_1 in the FROM clause.
. `FULL OUTER JOIN table_2` represents the **right table** with table_2 in the FULL OUTER JOIN condition.
. `ON table_1.matching_field = table_2.matching_field` sets the join condition after the **ON** keyword with the matching field between the two tables.&#x20;

### Syntax with an Alias

You can use an alias to refer to the table’s name. The results will stay the same. It only helps to write the query easier.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT A.column_1, B.column_2...
FROM table_1 A //table_1 as A
FULL OUTER JOIN table_2 B //table_2 as B
ON A.matching_field = B.matching_field;
----


[NOTE]
====
If there are no matched records from the joined tables, the `NULL` values will return in every column of the table that doesn’t have the matching record.
====


## Example

**departments table**

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE departments (
	department_id int,
	department_name text
);
INSERT INTO departments (department_id,department_name)
VALUES
	(1001, 'Sales'),
	(1002, 'Marketing'),
	(1003, 'HR'),
	(1004, 'Project'),
	(1005, 'Product');
----


[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM departments;
----


It will create a **departments** table as shown below:

[source,sql]

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
|department_id |department_name

|1001 |Sales
|1002 |Marketing
|1003 |HR
|1004 |Project
|1005 |Product
|===



**employee table**

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE employee (
	employee_id int,
	employee_name text,
	dept_id int
);
INSERT INTO employee (
	employee_id,
	employee_name,
    dept_id
)
VALUES
	(2001,'Tony Stark', 1002),
	(2002,'Christian Bale', 1002),
	(2003,'Anne Hailey', 1003),
	(2004,'Wilson Cliff', 1004),
	(2005,'Susan Oh', 1001),
	(2006,'Julian Robert', 1001),
    (2007,'Gilbert Tom', null);
----


[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM employee;
----


It will create an **employee** table as shown below:

[source,sql]

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
|employee_id |employee_name |dept_id

|2001 |Tony Stark |1002
|2002 |Christian Bale |1002
|2003 |Anne Hailey |1003
|2004 |Wilson Cliff |1004
|2005 |Susan Oh |1001
|2006 |Julian Robert |1001
|2007 |Gilbert Tom |null
|===

### Case 1: FULL OUTER JOIN

1\) Based on the above tables, we can write an `OUTER JOIN` query as follows:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT employee_name, department_name
FROM departments
FULL OUTER JOIN employee
ON departments.department_id = employee.dept_id;
----


2\) The result will show every department with an employee and the employee who works under a specific department.

3\) It also includes every department that does not have any employees and the employees who do not belong to a specific department.

[source,sql]

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
|employee_name |department_name

|Julian Robert |Sales
|Susan Oh |Sales
|Christian Bale |Marketing
|Tony Stark |Marketing
|Anne Hailey |HR
|Wilson Cliff |Project
|Gilbert Tom |null
|null |Product
|===

### Case 2: `FULL OUTER JOIN` with `WHERE` Clause

**a) Employee**

. We can look up the department that does not have any employees by adding a `WHERE` clause and `NULL` as the following query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT employee_name, department_name
FROM departments
FULL OUTER JOIN employee
ON departments.department_id = employee.dept_id
WHERE employee_name IS NULL;
----


. The result will indicate that the **Product** department doesn’t have any employees 👨🏻‍💼

[source,sql]

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
|employee_name |department_name

|null |Product
|===



**b) Department**

1\) Let’s find out the employee who doesn’t belong to any department by adding a WHERE clause and NULL as the following query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT employee_name, department_name
FROM employee
FULL OUTER JOIN departments
ON employee.dept_id = departments.department_id
WHERE department_name IS NULL;
----


2\) The result will show that **Gilbert Tom** doesn’t belong to any department 👨🏻‍💼

[source,sql]

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
|employee_name |department_name

|Gilbert Tom |null
|===
