= Keywords


In Oxla, **reserved** and **non-reserved** keywords play an important role in SQL syntax and usage.
Reserved keywords are strictly defined by the SQL standard and cannot be used as identifiers, such as table or column names, unless explicitly quoted. These keywords have predefined meanings and are always interpreted as part of the SQL syntax, for example, `SELECT`, `INSERT` and `UPDATE`.

On the other hand, non-reserved keywords have special meanings only in specific context and can be used as identifiers in other situations.  For example, the keyword `DB` is non-reserved, meaning you can use it directly to name a database.

The table below lists all available keywords that you can use in statements:
