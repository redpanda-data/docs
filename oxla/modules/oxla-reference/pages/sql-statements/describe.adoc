= DESCRIBE


## Overview

The `DESCRIBE` statement is used to show columns within a table as well as tables within a database.

[TIP]
====
It is recommended to be used before creating a new table to avoid tables duplication
====


## Syntax

Below you can find the basic syntax for describing tables within a database as well as columns within tables:

[source,sql]
----
DESCRIBE DATABASE;
----


[source,sql]
----
DESCRIBE TABLE table_name;
----


where:

`table_name`: name of the table that you want to show

[NOTE]
====
This statement is available to all users with the `USAGE` privilege on the schema, where the table is located
====


## Examples

To get a better understanding of the `DESCRIBE` statement, take a look at some examples below:

### DESCRIBE Table

In this example, we will figure out the columns of the **part** table. In order to do so, you need to run the query below:

[source,sql]
----
DESCRIBE TABLE part;
----


As a result, you will get a list of column names, column types, and nullable options from the **part** table:

[source,sql]
----
+----------------+------------+-------------+-------+----------+
----

[cols="1,1,1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
|database_name |table_name |name |type |nullable

|public |part |p_partkey |INT |f
|public |part |p_name |TEXT |f
|public |part |p_mfgr |TEXT |f
|public |part |p_category |TEXT |f
|public |part |p_brand |TEXT |f
|public |part |p_color |TEXT |f
|public |part |p_type |TEXT |f
|public |part |p_size |INT |f
|public |part |p_container |TEXT |f
|===



[TIP]
====
The example above shows that the tables reside in the `public` schema (the default schema in Oxla). You can also display tables from other schemas, by following the doc xref:oxla-reference:schema.adoc[here]
====


### DESCRIBE Database

In order to describe the database, you need to execute the following query:

[source,sql]
----
DESCRIBE DATABASE;
----


The output for the above code consists of all existing tables from the specified database, as presented below:

[cols="1",options="header"]
|===
|name

|supplier_scale_1_no_index
|features
|orders
|features2
|featurestable
|featurestable1
|featurestable10
|===
