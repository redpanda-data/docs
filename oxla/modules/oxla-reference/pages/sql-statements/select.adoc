= SELECT

== Overview

The `SELECT` statement helps you obtain the data you need from one or more tables.

The application of this statement will be helpful in several cases listed below:

* Evaluating data from only particular fields in a table.
* Reviewing data from several tables at the same time.
* Retrieving the data based on specific criteria.

== Syntax

To request data from a table using the `SELECT` statement, you can use the following syntax:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM table_name;
----

You are allowed to filter the table by column. Refer to the syntax below.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
----

We will define each syntax as follows.

* `SELECT` determines the data we need from the database or a table.
* `*` referred to as *select star* or *asterisk* or represents *all*. It defines that the query should return all columns of the queried tables.
* `FROM` clause indicates the table(s) to retrieve data from.
* `table_name` represents the table(s) name.
* `column1, column2, ...` these are used to specify the columns from where we want to retrieve the data.

[NOTE]
====
The `SELECT` statement is case insensitive, which means `select` or `SELECT` has the same result.
====

== Examples

We have a table named *student_data* that stores the id, name, and where the student lives.

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE student_data (
  id int,
  name text,
  domicile text
);
INSERT INTO student_data
    (id, name, domicile)
VALUES
    (119291,'Jordan','Los Angeles'),
    (119292,'Mike','Melbourne'),
    (119293,'Will','Sydney');
----

[TIP]
====
All the examples below are executed in the `public` schema. You can also display table from another specific schema.

=== Case #1: Query data from all columns

. In the first case, we want to display all the data from the *student_data* table. Please refer to the syntax below:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM table_name;
----

. Use the `SELECT` statement within the table name to get all the data:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM student_data;
----

. If you have successfully run the query, you will get all the data from the *student_data* table.
+
[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
|id |name |domicile

|119291 |Jordan |Los Angeles
|119292 |Mike |Melbourne
|119293 |Will |Sydney
|===

=== Case #2: Query data from specific columns

. We want to get the list of students' names with their IDs. Please refer to the syntax below:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT column_1, column_2 FROM table_name;
----

. Run the following query:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT id, name FROM student_data;
----

. If you have successfully run the query, you will get a list of students' IDs & names from the *student_data* table.
+
[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
|id |name

|119291 |Jordan
|119292 |Mike
|119293 |Will
|===

=== Case #3: Query data from a specific column with the condition

. If we have a large number of data, skimming for the desired data will require a long time. We can apply some conditions to the `SELECT` statement. Please refer to the syntax below:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT column_1 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
----

. Let's say we want to know the student's name who lives in Sydney, have a look and run the query below:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT name FROM student_data WHERE domicile='Sydney';
----

. If you have successfully run the query, we now know that Will lives in Sydney.
+
[cols="1",options="header"]
|===
|name

|Will
|===
