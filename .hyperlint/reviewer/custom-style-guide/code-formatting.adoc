= Redpanda Data Documentation Code Formatting Guidelines

== Commands and code

Don't start a sentence not inside a code block with a command or code. Instead, try to move the code into the middle of the sentence. For example, you can introduce the command with a more descriptive word like “Run”.

*Correct:* Run the `rpk topic create` command to create a new topic.

*Incorrect:* `rpk topic create` creates a new topic.

Similarly, do not start a sentence with a filename.

*Correct:* The `redpanda.yaml` file contains configuration parameters.

*Incorrect:* `redpanda.yaml` contains configuration parameters.

This version is correct because the sentence starts with the definite article, providing a descriptive context before introducing the xref.

*Correct:*

[,asciidoc]
----
The xref:api:ROOT:admin-api.adoc#get-/v1/broker/pre_restart_probe[`pre_restart_probe`] endpoint identifies potential risks if a broker is restarted.
----

*Incorrect:*

[,asciidoc]
----
xref:api:ROOT:admin-api.adoc#get-/v1/broker/pre_restart_probe[`pre_restart_probe`] is an endpoint.
----

This version is incorrect because it starts directly with the xref. According to our style guidelines, sentences should not begin with a command, code snippet, or filename. Instead, the xref should be integrated into a descriptive sentence.
