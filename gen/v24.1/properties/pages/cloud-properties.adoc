Cloud properties intro

== Cloud

=== cloud_storage_access_key

AWS access key.

*Requires Restart:* No

*Nullable:* Yes

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* string

*Default:* `null`

---

=== cloud_storage_api_endpoint

Optional API endpoint.

=== cloud_storage_attempt_cluster_restore_on_bootstrap

If set to `true`, when a cluster is started for the first time and there is cluster metadata in the configured cloud storage bucket, Redpanda automatically starts a cluster restore from that metadata. If using an automated method for deployment where it's not easy to predictably determine that a restore is needed, we recommend setting to `true`. Take care to ensure that in such deployments, a cluster bootstrap with a given bucket means that any previous cluster using that bucket is fully destroyed; otherwise tiered storage subsystems may interfere with each other.

=== cloud_storage_azure_hierarchical_namespace_enabled

Whether or not Azure Hierarchical Namespaces are enabled on the cloud_storage_azure_storage_account.

---

=== cloud_storage_manifest_cache_ttl_ms

The time interval that determines how long the materialized manifest can stay in cache under contention. This parameter is used for performance tuning. When the spillover manifest is materialized and stored in cache and the cache needs to evict it it will use 'cloud_storage_materialized_manifest_ttl_ms' value as a timeout. The cursor that uses the spillover manifest uses this value as a TTL interval after which it stops referencing the manifest making it available for eviction. This only affects spillover manifests under contention.

*Requires Restart:* No

---

=== cloud_storage_max_concurrent_hydrations_per_shard

Maximum concurrent segment hydrations of remote data per CPU core.  If unset, value of `cloud_storage_max_connections / 2` is used, which means that half of available S3 bandwidth could be used to download data from S3. If the cloud storage cache is empty every new segment reader will require a download. This will lead to 1:1 mapping between number of partitions scanned by the fetch request and number of parallel downloads. If this value is too large the downloads can affect other workloads. In case of any problem caused by the tiered-storage reads this value can be lowered. This will only affect segment hydrations (downloads) but won't affect cached segments. If fetch request is reading from the tiered-storage cache its concurrency will only be limited by available memory.

Maximum concurrent I/O cursors of materialized remote segments per CPU core.  If unset, value of `topic_partitions_per_shard` is used, i.e. one segment reader per partition if the shard is at its maximum partition capacity.  These readers are cachedacross Kafka consume requests and store a readahead buffer.

*Requires Restart:* No

*Nullable:* Yes

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `null`

---

=== cloud_storage_max_segments_pending_deletion_per_partition

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `5000`

---

=== cloud_storage_max_throughput_per_shard

=== cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_max_segments

Maximum number of elements in the spillover manifest that can be offloaded to the cloud storage. This property is similar to 'cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_size' but it triggers spillover based on number of segments instead of the size of the manifest in bytes.

Note that even if the tiered-storage is allowed to use full bandwidth of the disk (100%) it won't necessary use it in full. The actual usage depend on your workload and the state of the tiered-storage cache. This parameter is a safeguard that prevents tiered-storage from using too many system resources and not a performance tuning knob.
