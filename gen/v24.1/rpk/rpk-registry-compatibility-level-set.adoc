= rpk registry compatibility-level set
:description: rpk registry compatibility-level set

Set the global or per-subject compatibility levels.

Running this command without a subject sets the global compatibility level. To
set the global level at the same time as per-subject levels, use the --global
flag.

LEVELS:

  - BACKWARD (default): Consumers using the new schema (for example, version 10)
    can read data from producers using the previous schema (for example, version
    9).

  - BACKWARD_TRANSITIVE: Consumers using the new schema (for example, version
    10) can read data from producers using all previous schemas (for example,
    versions 1-9).

  - FORWARD: Consumers using the previous schema (for example, version 9) can
    read data from producers using the new schema (for example, version 10).

  - FORWARD_TRANSITIVE: Consumers using any previous schema (for example,
    versions 1-9) can read data from producers using the new schema (for example,
    version 10).

  - FULL: A new schema and the previous schema (for example, versions 10 and 9)
    are both backward and forward compatible with each other.

  - FULL_TRANSITIVE: Each schema is both backward and forward compatible with
    all registered schemas.

  - NONE: No schema compatibility checks are done.
