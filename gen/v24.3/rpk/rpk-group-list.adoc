= rpk group list
:description: rpk group list

List all groups.

This command lists all groups currently known to Redpanda, including empty
groups that have not yet expired. The BROKER column is which broker node is the
coordinator for the group. This command can be used to track down unknown
groups, or to list groups that need to be cleaned up.

The STATE columns shows which state the group is in:
  - PreparingRebalance: The group is preparing to rebalance.
  - CompletingRebalance: The group is waiting on the leader to provide assignments.
  - Stable: The group is not empty and has no group membership changes in process.
  - Dead: Transient state as the group is being removed.
  - Empty: The group currently has no members.
