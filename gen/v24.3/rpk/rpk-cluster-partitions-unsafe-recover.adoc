= rpk cluster partitions unsafe-recover
:description: rpk cluster partitions unsafe-recover

Recover unsafely from partitions that have lost majority.

This command allows you to unsafely recover all data adversely affected by the
loss of the nodes specified in the '--from-nodes' flag. This operation is unsafe 
because it allows you to bulk move all partitions that have lost majority when 
nodes are gone and irrecoverable; this may result in data loss.

You can perform a dry run and verify the partitions that will be recovered by 
using the '--dry' flag.
