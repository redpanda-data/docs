:description: rpk topic produce

Produce records to a topic.

Producing records reads from STDIN, parses input according to --format, and
produce records to Redpanda. The input formatter understands a wide variety of
formats.

Parsing input operates on either sizes or on delimiters, both of which can be
specified in the same formatting options. If using sizes to specify something,
the size must come before what it is specifying. Delimiters match on an exact
text basis. This command will quit with an error if any input fails to match
your specified format.

Slashes can be used for common escapes:

    \t \n \r \\ \xNN

matches tabs, newlines, carriage returns, slashes, and hex encoded characters.

Percent encoding reads into specific values of a record:

    %t    topic
    %T    topic length
    %k    key
    %K    key length
    %v    value
    %V    value length
    %h    begin the header specification
    %H    number of headers
    %p    partition (if using the --partition flag)

Three escapes exist to parse characters that are used to modify the previous
escapes:

    %%    percent sign
    %{    left brace
    %}    right brace

MODIFIERS

Text and numbers can be read in multiple formats, and the default format can be
changed within brace modifiers. %v reads a value, while %v{hex} reads a value
and then hex decodes it before producing. %T reads the length of a topic from
the input, while %T{3} reads exactly three bytes for a topic from the input.

All modifiers go within braces following a percent-escape.

NUMBERS

Reading number values can have the following modifiers:

     ascii       parse numeric digits until a non-numeric (default)

     hex64       sixteen hex characters
     hex32       eight hex characters
     hex16       four hex characters
     hex8        two hex characters
     hex4        one hex character

     big64       eight byte big endian number
     big32       four byte big endian number
     big16       two byte big endian number
     big8        alias for byte

     little64    eight byte little endian number
     little32    four byte little endian number
     little16    two byte little endian number
     little8     alias for byte

     byte        one byte number
     <digits>    directly specify the length as this many digits
     bool        read "true" as 1, "false" as 0

When reading number sizes, the size corresponds to the size of the encoded
values, not the decoded values. "%T{6}%t{hex}" will read six hex bytes and
decode into three.

TEXT

Reading text values can have the following modifiers:

    hex       read text then hex decode it
    base64    read text then std-encoding base64 decode it
    re        read text matching a regular expression
    json      read text as json then compact it

HEADERS

Headers are parsed with an internal key / value specifier format. For example,
the following will read three headers that begin and end with a space and are
separated by an equal:

    %H{3}%h{ %k=%v }

SCHEMA-REGISTRY

Records can be encoded using a specified schema from our schema registry. Use
the '--schema-id' or '--schema-key-id' flags to define the schema ID, rpk will
retrieve the schemas and encode the record accordingly.

Additionally, utilizing 'topic' in the mentioned flags allows for the use of the
Topic Name Strategy. This strategy identifies a schema subject name based on the
topic itself. For example:

Produce to 'foo', encode using the latest schema in the subject 'foo-value':
    rpk topic produce foo --schema-id=topic

For protobuf schemas, you can specify the fully qualified name of the message
you want the record to be encoded with. Use the 'schema-type' flag or
'schema-key-type'. If the schema contains only one message, specifying the
message name is unnecessary. For example:

Produce to 'foo', using schema ID 1, message FQN Person.Name
    rpk topic produce foo --schema-id 1 --schema-type Person.Name

TOMBSTONES

By default, records produced without a value will have an empty-string value, "".
The below example produces a record with the key 'not_a_tombstone_record' and the
value "":
    rpk topic produce foo -k not_a_tombstone_record
    [ret]

Tombstone records (records with a 'null' value) can be produced by using the '-Z'
flag and creating empty-string value records. Using the same example from above,
but adding the '-Z' flag will produce a record with the key 'tombstone_record'
and the value 'null':
    rpk topic produce foo -k tombstone_record -Z
    [ret]

It is important to note that records produced with values of string "null" are
not considered tombstones by Redpanda.

EXAMPLES

In the below examples, we can parse many records at once. The produce command
reads input and tokenizes based on your specified format. Every time the format
is completely matched, a record is produced and parsing begins anew.

A key and value, separated by a space and ending in newline:
    -f '%k %v\n'
A four byte topic, four byte key, and four byte value:
    -f '%T{4}%K{4}%V{4}%t%k%v'
A value to a specific partition, if using a non-negative --partition flag:
    -f '%p %v\n'
A big-endian uint16 key size, the text " foo ", and then that key:
    -f '%K{big16} foo %k'
A value that can be two or three characters followed by a newline:
    -f '%v{re#...?#}\n'
A key and a json value, separated by a space:
    -f '%k %v{json}'

MISC

Producing requires a topic to produce to. The topic can be specified either
directly on as an argument, or in the input text through %t. A parsed topic
takes precedence over the default passed in topic. If no topic is specified
directly and no topic is parsed, this command will quit with an error.

The input format can parse partitions to produce directly to with %p. Doing so
requires specifying a non-negative --partition flag. Any parsed partition
takes precedence over the --partition flag; specifying the flag is the main
requirement for being able to directly control which partition to produce to.

You can also specify an output format to write when a record is produced
successfully. The output format follows the same formatting rules as the topic
consume command. See that command's help text for a detailed description.
