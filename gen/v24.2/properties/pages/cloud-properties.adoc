Cloud properties intro

== Cloud

=== cloud_storage_access_key

*Requires Restart:* No

*Nullable:* Yes

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* string

*Default:* `null`

---

=== cloud_storage_api_endpoint

=== cloud_storage_attempt_cluster_restore_on_bootstrap

If set to `true`, when a cluster is started for the first time and there is cluster metadata in the configured cloud storage bucket, Redpanda automatically starts a cluster restore from that metadata. If using an automated method for deployment where it's not easy to predictably determine that a restore is needed, we recommend setting to `true`. Take care to ensure that in such deployments, a cluster bootstrap with a given bucket means that any previous cluster using that bucket is fully destroyed; otherwise tiered storage subsystems may interfere with each other.

---

=== cloud_storage_max_concurrent_hydrations_per_shard

Maximum concurrent segment hydrations of remote data per CPU core.  If unset, value of `cloud_storage_max_connections / 2` is used, which means that half of available S3 bandwidth could be used to download data from S3. If the cloud storage cache is empty every new segment reader will require a download. This will lead to 1:1 mapping between number of partitions scanned by the fetch request and number of parallel downloads. If this value is too large the downloads can affect other workloads. In case of any problem caused by the tiered-storage reads this value can be lowered. This will only affect segment hydrations (downloads) but won't affect cached segments. If fetch request is reading from the tiered-storage cache its concurrency will only be limited by available memory.

=== cloud_storage_segment_max_upload_interval_sec

Time that segment can be kept locally without uploading it to the remote storage (sec).

*Requires Restart:* No

*Nullable:* Yes

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Accepted values:* [`-17179869184`, `17179869183`]

*Default:* `1h`

---

=== cloud_storage_segment_size_min

Smallest acceptable segment size in the cloud storage. Default: cloud_storage_segment_size_target/2.

*Requires Restart:* No

*Nullable:* Yes

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `null`

---

=== cloud_storage_segment_size_target

Desired segment size in the cloud storage. Default: segment.bytes.

*Requires Restart:* No

*Nullable:* Yes

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `null`

---

=== cloud_storage_segment_upload_timeout_ms

Log segment upload timeout (ms).

*Requires Restart:* No

*Nullable:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Accepted values:* [`-17592186044416`, `17592186044415`]

*Default:* `30s`

=== cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_max_segments

Maximum number of elements in the spillover manifest that can be offloaded to the cloud storage. This property is similar to 'cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_size' but it triggers spillover based on number of segments instead of the size of the manifest in bytes. The property exists to simplify testing and shouldn't be set in the production environment.

*Requires Restart:* No

*Nullable:* Yes

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `null`

---

=== cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_size

The size of the manifest which can be offloaded to the cloud. If the size of the local manifest stored in redpanda exceeds cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_size x2 the spillover mechanism will split the manifest into two parts and one of them will be uploaded to S3.

*Requires Restart:* No

*Nullable:* Yes

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `65536`

---

=== cloud_storage_throughput_limit_percent

Max throughput used by tiered-storage per node expressed as a percentage of the disk bandwidth. If the server has several disks Redpanda will take into account only the one which is used to store tiered-storage cache. Note that even if the tiered-storage is allowed to use full bandwidth of the disk (100%) it won't necessary use it in full. The actual usage depend on your workload and the state of the tiered-storage cache. This parameter is a safeguard that prevents tiered-storage from using too many system resources and not a performance tuning knob.

*Requires Restart:* No

*Nullable:* Yes

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `50`

---

=== cloud_storage_topic_purge_grace_period_ms

Grace period during which the purger will refuse to purge the topic.

*Requires Restart:* No

*Nullable:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Accepted values:* [`-17592186044416`, `17592186044415`]

*Default:* `30s`

---

=== cloud_storage_trust_file

Path to certificate that should be used to validate server certificate during TLS handshake.

*Requires Restart:* No

*Nullable:* Yes

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* string

*Default:* `null`

---

=== cloud_storage_upload_ctrl_d_coeff

Derivative coefficient for upload PID controller.

*Requires Restart:* No

*Nullable:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* number

*Default:* `0.0`

---

=== cloud_storage_upload_ctrl_max_shares

Maximum number of IO and CPU shares that archival upload can use.

*Requires Restart:* No

*Nullable:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Accepted values:* [`-32768`, `32767`]

*Default:* `1000`

---

=== cloud_storage_upload_ctrl_min_shares

Minimum number of IO and CPU shares that archival upload can use.

*Requires Restart:* No

*Nullable:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Accepted values:* [`-32768`, `32767`]

*Default:* `100`

---

=== cloud_storage_upload_ctrl_p_coeff

Proportional coefficient for upload PID controller.

*Requires Restart:* No

*Nullable:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* number

*Default:* `-2.0`

---

=== cloud_storage_upload_loop_initial_backoff_ms

Initial backoff interval when there is nothing to upload for a partition (ms).

*Requires Restart:* No

*Nullable:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Accepted values:* [`-17592186044416`, `17592186044415`]

*Default:* `100ms`

---

=== cloud_storage_upload_loop_max_backoff_ms

Max backoff interval when there is nothing to upload for a partition (ms).

*Requires Restart:* No

*Nullable:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Accepted values:* [`-17592186044416`, `17592186044415`]

*Default:* `10s`

---

=== cloud_storage_url_style

Specifies the addressing style to use for Amazon S3 requests. This configuration determines how S3 bucket URLs are formatted. You can choose between: `virtual_host`, (e.g. `<bucket-name>.s3.amazonaws.com`), `path`, (e.g. `s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket-name>`), and `null`. Path style is supported for backward compatibility with legacy systems. When this property is not set (`null`), the client tries to use `virtual_host` addressing. If the initial request fails, the client automatically tries the `path` style. If neither addressing style works, Redpanda terminates the startup, requiring manual configuration to proceed.

*Requires Restart:* Yes

*Nullable:* Yes

*Visibility:* `user`

*Default:* `null`
