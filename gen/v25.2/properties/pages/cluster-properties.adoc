= Cluster Configuration Properties
:page-aliases: reference:tunable-properties.adoc, reference:cluster-properties.adoc
:description: Cluster configuration properties list.

Cluster configuration properties are the same for all brokers in a cluster, and are set at the cluster level.

For information on how to edit cluster properties, see xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/cluster-property-configuration.adoc[] or xref:manage:kubernetes/k-cluster-property-configuration.adoc[].

NOTE: Some cluster properties require that you restart the cluster for any updates to take effect. See the specific property details to identify whether or not a restart is required.

== Cluster configuration

=== abort_index_segment_size

Capacity (in number of txns) of an abort index segment. Each partition tracks the aborted transaction offset ranges to help service client requests.If the number transactions increase beyond this threshold, they are flushed to disk to easy memory pressure.Then they're loaded on demand. This configuration controls the maximum number of aborted transactions  before they are flushed to disk.

*Requires restart:* Yes

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Accepted values:* [`0`, `4294967295`]

*Default:* `50000`

---

---

=== aggregate_metrics

=== fetch_read_strategy

The strategy used to fulfill fetch requests. * `polling`: Repeatedly polls every partition in the request for new data. The polling interval is set by `fetch_reads_debounce_timeout` (deprecated). * `non_polling`: The backend is signaled when a partition has new data, so Redpanda does not need to repeatedly read from every partition in the fetch. Redpanda Data recommends using this value for most workloads, because it can improve fetch latency and CPU utilization. * `non_polling_with_debounce`: This option behaves like `non_polling`, but it includes a debounce mechanism with a fixed delay specified by `fetch_reads_debounce_timeout` at the start of each fetch. By introducing this delay, Redpanda can accumulate more data before processing, leading to fewer fetch operations and returning larger amounts of data. Enabling this option reduces reactor utilization, but it may also increase end-to-end latency.

=== minimum_topic_replications

Minimum allowable replication factor for topics in this cluster. The set value must be positive, odd, and equal to or less than the number of available brokers. Changing this parameter only restricts newly-created topics. Redpanda returns an `INVALID_REPLICATION_FACTOR` error on any attempt to create a topic with a replication factor less than this property. If you change the `minimum_topic_replications` setting, the replication factor of existing topics remains unchanged. However, Redpanda will log a warning on start-up with a list of any topics that have fewer replicas than this minimum. For example, you might see a message such as `Topic X has a replication factor less than specified minimum: 1 < 3`.

=== storage_ignore_timestamps_in_future_sec

The maximum number of seconds that a record's timestamp can be ahead of a Redpanda broker's clock and still be used when deciding whether to clean up the record for data retention. This property makes possible the timely cleanup of records from clients with clocks that are drastically unsynchronized relative to Redpanda. When determining whether to clean up a record with timestamp more than `storage_ignore_timestamps_in_future_sec` seconds ahead of the broker, Redpanda ignores the record's timestamp and instead uses a valid timestamp of another record in the same segment, or (if another record's valid timestamp is unavailable) the timestamp of when the segment file was last modified (mtime). By default, `storage_ignore_timestamps_in_future_sec` is disabled (null). To figure out whether to set `storage_ignore_timestamps_in_future_sec` for your system: . Look for logs with segments that are unexpectedly large and not being cleaned up. . In the logs, search for records with unsynchronized timestamps that are further into the future than tolerable by your data retention and storage settings. For example, timestamps 60 seconds or more into the future can be considered to be too unsynchronized. . If you find unsynchronized timestamps throughout your logs, determine the number of seconds that the timestamps are ahead of their actual time, and set `storage_ignore_timestamps_in_future_sec` to that value so data retention can proceed. . If you only find unsynchronized timestamps that are the result of transient behavior, you can disable `storage_ignore_timestamps_in_future_sec`.

=== topic_memory_per_partition

Required memory in bytes per partition replica when creating or altering topics.

---

=== write_caching_default

The default write caching mode to apply to user topics. Write caching acknowledges a message as soon as it is received and acknowledged on a majority of brokers, without waiting for it to be written to disk. With `acks=all`, this provides lower latency while still ensuring that a majority of brokers acknowledge the write. Fsyncs follow `raft_replica_max_pending_flush_bytes` and `raft_replica_max_flush_delay_ms`, whichever is reached first. The `write_caching_default` cluster property can be overridden with the `write.caching` topic property. Accepted values: * `true` * `false` * `disabled`: This takes precedence over topic overrides and disables write caching for the entire cluster.

*Requires restart:* No

*Visibility:* `user`

*Default:* `model::write_caching_mode::default_false`

=== zstd_decompress_workspace_bytes

Size of the zstd decompression workspace.
