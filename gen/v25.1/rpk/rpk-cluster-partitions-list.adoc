= rpk cluster partitions list
:description: rpk cluster partitions list

List partitions in the cluster

This commands lists the cluster-level metadata of all partitions in the cluster.
It shows the current replica assignments on both brokers and CPU cores for given
topics. By default, it assumes the "kafka" namespace, but you can specify an
internal namespace using the "{namespace}/" prefix.

The REPLICA-CORE column displayed in the output table contains a list of
replicas assignments in the form of: <Node-ID>-<Core>.

If the DISABLED column contains a '-' value, then it means you are running this
command against a cluster that does not support the underlying API.

ENABLED/DISABLED

Disabling a partition in Redpanda involves prohibiting any data consumption or
production to and from it. All internal processes associated with the partition
are stopped, and it remains unloaded during system startup. This measure aims to
maintain cluster health by preventing issues caused by specific corrupted
partitions that may lead to Redpanda crashes. Although the data remains stored
on disk, Redpanda ceases interaction with the disabled partitions to ensure
system stability.

You may disable/enable partition using 'rpk cluster partitions enable/disable'.	

EXAMPLES

List all partitions in the cluster.
  rpk cluster partitions list --all

List all partitions in the cluster, filtering for topic foo and bar.
  rpk cluster partitions list foo bar

List partitions which replicas are assigned to brokers 1 and 2.
  rpk cluster partitions list foo --node-ids 1,2

List only the disabled partitions.
  rpk cluster partitions list -a --disabled-only

List all in json format.
  rpk cluster partition list -a --format json
