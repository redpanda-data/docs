= rpk transform logs
:description: rpk transform logs

View logs for a transform.

Data transform's STDOUT and STDERR are captured during runtime and written to 
an internally managed topic _redpanda.transform_logs.
This command outputs logs for a single transform over a period of time and 
printing them to STDOUT. The logs can be printed in various formats.

By default, only logs that have been emitted are displayed.
Use the --follow flag to stream new logs continuously.

FILTERING

The --head and --tail flags are mutually exclusive and limit the number of log
entries from the beginning or end of the range, respectively.

The --since and --until flags define a time range. Use one of both flags to
limit the log output to a desired period of time.

Both flags accept values in the following formats:
    
    now                   the current time, useful for --since=now
    13 digits             parsed as a Unix millisecond
    9 digits              parsed as a Unix second
    YYYY-MM-DD            parsed as a day, UTC
    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ  parsed as RFC3339, UTC; fractional seconds optional (.MMM)
    -dur                  a negative duration from now
    dur                   a positive duration from now

Durations are parsed simply:

    3ms    three milliseconds
    10s    ten seconds
    9m     nine minutes
    1h     one hour
    1m3ms  one minute and three milliseconds

For example,

    --since=-1h   reads logs within the last hour
    --until=-30m  reads logs prior to 30 minutes ago

The following command reads logs between noon and 1pm on March 12th:

    rpk transform logs my-transform --since=2024-03-12T12:00:00Z --until=2024-03-12T13:00:00Z

FORMATTING

Logs can be displayed in a variety of formats using --format.

The default --format=text prints the log record's body line by line.

When --format=wide is specified, the output includes a prefix that is the
date of the log line and a level for the record. The INFO level corresponds 
to being emitted on the transform's STDOUT, while the WARN level is used
for STDERR.

The --format=json flag emits logs in the JSON encoded version of 
the Open Telemetry LogRecord protocol buffer.
