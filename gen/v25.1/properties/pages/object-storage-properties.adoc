= Object Storage Properties
:description: Reference of object storage properties.

Object storage properties are a type of cluster property. For information on how to edit cluster properties, see xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/cluster-property-configuration.adoc[].

NOTE: Some object storage properties require that you restart the cluster for any updates to take effect. See the specific property details to identify whether or not a restart is required.

== Object storage configuration

Object storage properties should only be set if you enable xref:manage:tiered-storage.adoc[Tiered Storage].

=== cloud_storage_access_key

AWS or GCP access key. This access key is part of the credentials that Redpanda requires to authenticate with object storage services for Tiered Storage. This access key is used with the <<cloud_storage_secret_key>> to form the complete credentials required for authentication. To authenticate using IAM roles, see cloud_storage_credentials_source.

When the spillover manifest is materialized and stored in cache and the cache needs to evict it it will use 'cloud_storage_materialized_manifest_ttl_ms' value as a timeout. The cursor that uses the spillover manifest uses this value as a TTL interval after which it stops referencing the manifest making it available for eviction.

=== cloud_storage_max_concurrent_hydrations_per_shard

Maximum concurrent segment hydrations of remote data per CPU core.  If unset, value of `cloud_storage_max_connections / 2` is used, which means that half of available S3 bandwidth could be used to download data from S3. If the cloud storage cache is empty every new segment reader will require a download. This will lead to 1:1 mapping between number of partitions scanned by the fetch request and number of parallel downloads. If this value is too large the downloads can affect other workloads. In case of any problem caused by the tiered-storage reads this value can be lowered. This will only affect segment hydrations (downloads) but won't affect cached segments. If fetch request is reading from the tiered-storage cache its concurrency will only be limited by available memory.

=== cloud_storage_recovery_topic_validation_depth

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Accepted values:* [`0`, `4294967295`]

*Default:* `10`

=== cloud_storage_recovery_topic_validation_mode

Validation performed before recovering a topic from object storage. In case of failure, the reason for the failure appears as `ERROR` lines in the Redpanda application log. For each topic, this reports errors for all partitions, but for each partition, only the first error is reported. This property accepts the following parameters: `no_check`: Skips the checks for topic recovery. `check_manifest_existence`:  Runs an existence check on each `partition_manifest`. Fails if there are connection issues to the object storage. `check_manifest_and_segment_metadata`: Downloads the manifest and runs a consistency check, comparing the metadata with the cloud storage objects. The process fails if metadata references any missing cloud storage objects.

*Requires restart:* No

=== cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_max_segments

Maximum number of elements in the spillover manifest that can be offloaded to the cloud storage. This property is similar to 'cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_size' but it triggers spillover based on number of segments instead of the size of the manifest in bytes. The property exists to simplify testing and shouldn't be set in the production environment.

*Requires restart:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `null`

---

=== cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_size

The size of the manifest which can be offloaded to the cloud. If the size of the local manifest stored in redpanda exceeds cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_size x2 the spillover mechanism will split the manifest into two parts and one of them will be uploaded to S3.

*Requires restart:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `64_kib`

---

=== cloud_storage_throughput_limit_percent

Max throughput used by tiered-storage per node expressed as a percentage of the disk bandwidth. If the server has several disks Redpanda will take into account only the one which is used to store tiered-storage cache. Note that even if the tiered-storage is allowed to use full bandwidth of the disk (100%) it won't necessary use it in full. The actual usage depend on your workload and the state of the tiered-storage cache. This parameter is a safeguard that prevents tiered-storage from using too many system resources and not a performance tuning knob.

*Unit:* percent

*Requires restart:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `50`

---

=== cloud_storage_topic_purge_grace_period_ms

Grace period during which the purger will refuse to purge the topic.

=== cloud_storage_upload_ctrl_min_shares

Minimum number of IO and CPU shares that archival upload can use.

=== cloud_storage_url_style

Specifies the addressing style to use for Amazon S3 requests. This configuration determines how S3 bucket URLs are formatted. You can choose between: `virtual_host`, (for example, `<bucket-name>.s3.amazonaws.com`), `path`, (for example, `s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket-name>`), and `null`. Path style is supported for backward compatibility with legacy systems. When this property is not set or is `null`, the client tries to use `virtual_host` addressing. If the initial request fails, the client automatically tries the `path` style. If neither addressing style works, Redpanda terminates the startup, requiring manual configuration to proceed.

*Requires restart:* Yes

*Visibility:* `user`

*Default:* `null`
