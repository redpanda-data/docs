:description: Deploy a data transform.

{badge-tech-preview}

Deploy a data transform.

To deploy a data transform configured by a `transform.yaml` configuration file, run the `rpk transform deploy` command in the same directory as `transform.yaml`. rpk reads the Wasm bundle with the same name as project. The names of the input and output topics for the transform are read either from `transform.yaml` (if they're specified) or from the command line flags `--input-topic` and `--output-topic`.

Alternatively, to deploy a data transform without a `transform.yaml` configuration file, specify on the command line both the Wasm bundle and the name of the transform:

```bash
rpk transform deploy transform.wasm --name myTransform
```

IMPORTANT: Technical preview features are not supported for production deployments.

== Usage

```bash
rpk transform deploy [flags]
```

== Flags
