[WARNING]
====
When you delete records from a topic with a timestamp, Redpanda advances the partition start offset to the first record whose timestamp is after the threshold. If record timestamps are not in order with respect to offsets, this may result in unintended deletion of data. Before using a timestamp, verify that timestamps increase in the same order as offsets in the topic to avoid accidental data loss. For example:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic consume <topic> -n 50 --format '%o %d{go[2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00]} %k %v'
