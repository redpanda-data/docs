[WARNING]
====
When you pass a timestamp to `rpk topic trim-prefix`, Redpanda advances the partition start offset to the first record whose timestamp is after the threshold. If record timestamps are not in order with respect to offsets, this may truncate an entire partition. Before using a timestamp, verify that timestamps increase in the same order as offsets in the topic to avoid unintended data loss. For example:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic consume <topic> -n 50 --format '%o %d{go[2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00]} %k %v'
