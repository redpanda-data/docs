This section pertains to Redpanda Console in a self-managed deployment, and this feature requires an xref:get-started:licenses.adoc[Enterprise license]. To upgrade, contact https://redpanda.com/try-redpanda?section=enterprise-trial[Redpanda sales^].

If Redpanda Console has enterprise features enabled and it cannot find a valid license either in its xref:console:config/enterprise-license.adoc[local configuration] or in the xref:get-started:licensing/add-license-redpanda/index.adoc[connected Redpanda cluster], it shuts down.
