This topic describes how to use the https://hub.docker.com/r/redpandadata/connectors/tags[Redpanda Connectors Docker image^], which
includes a pre-configured instance of https://redpanda.com/guides/kafka-tutorial/what-is-kafka-connect[Kafka Connect] that works
with Redpanda. 

The Redpanda Connectors Docker image contains _only_ the MirrorMaker2 connector but you can build a custom image to install additional connectors.
For a smoother experience, consider using the https://docs.redpanda.com/current/deploy/deployment-option/cloud/managed-connectors/[Managed Connectors] 
available in Redpanda Cloud.
