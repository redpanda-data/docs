Starting in Redpanda v25.3, several topic properties support enhanced tristate behavior. Properties like `retention.ms`, `retention.bytes`, `segment.ms`, and others now distinguish between zero values (immediate eligibility for cleanup/compaction) and negative values (disable the feature entirely). Previously, zero and negative values were treated the same way. For the complete list of affected properties and detailed information, see xref:25.3@get-started:release-notes/redpanda.adoc#behavior-changes[Redpanda v25.3 behavior changes]. Review your topic configurations if you currently use zero values for these properties.
