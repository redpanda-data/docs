====
Use xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc[/public_metrics] for your primary dashboards for monitoring system health. These metrics have low cardinality and are designed for customer consumption, with aggregated labels for better performance. *Public metrics use the `redpanda_` prefix.*

Use xref:reference:internal-metrics-reference.adoc[/metrics] for detailed analysis and debugging. These metrics can have high cardinality with thousands of series, providing granular operational insights. *Internal metrics use the `vectorized_` prefix.*
