:description: rpk profile
:rpk_version: v23.2.1

Manage rpk profiles.

An rpk profile talks to a single Redpanda cluster. You can create multiple
profiles for multiple clusters and swap between them with `rpk profile use`.
Multiple profiles may be useful if, for example, you use rpk to talk to
a localhost cluster, a dev cluster, and a prod cluster, and you want to keep
your configuration in one place.

== Usage
