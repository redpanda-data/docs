= Public Metrics
:description: Public metrics to create your system dashboard.
// tag::single-source[]

This section provides reference descriptions for the public metrics exported from Redpanda's `/public_metrics` endpoint.

// Cloud does not expose the internal metrics.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In a live system, Redpanda metrics are exported only for features that are in use. For example, Redpanda does not export metrics for consumer groups if no groups are registered.

To see the available public metrics in your system, query the `/public_metrics` endpoint:

== Cluster metrics

=== redpanda_cluster_brokers

Total number of fully commissioned brokers configured in the cluster.

*Type*: gauge

*Usage*: Create an alert if this gauge falls below a steady-state threshold, which may indicate that a broker has become unresponsive.

---

=== redpanda_cluster_controller_log_limit_requests_available_rps

The upper limit on the requests per second (RPS) that the cluster controller log is allowed to process, segmented by command group.

*Type*: gauge

*Labels*:

* `redpanda_cmd_group=("move_operations" | "topic_operations" | "configuration_operations" | "node_management_operations" | "acls_and_users_operations")`

---

=== redpanda_cluster_controller_log_limit_requests_dropped

The cumulative number of requests dropped by the controller log because the incoming rate exceeded the available RPS limit.

*Type*: counter

*Labels*:

* `redpanda_cmd_group=("move_operations" | "topic_operations" | "configuration_operations" | "node_management_operations" | "acls_and_users_operations")`

*Usage*: A rising counter indicates that requests are being dropped, which could signal overload or misconfiguration.

---

=== redpanda_cluster_features_enterprise_license_expiry_sec

Number of seconds remaining until the Enterprise Edition license expires.

*Type*: gauge

*Usage*:

- A value of `-1` indicates that no license is present.

- A value of `0` signifies an expired license.

Use this metric to proactively monitor license status and trigger alerts for timely renewal.

---

=== redpanda_cluster_latest_cluster_metadata_manifest_age

The amount of time in seconds since the last time Redpanda uploaded metadata files to Tiered Storage for your cluster. A value of `0` indicates metadata has not yet been uploaded.

When performing a whole cluster restore operation, metadata for new clusters will not include any changes made to a source cluster that is newer than this age.

*Type*: gauge

*Usage*: On a healthy system, this should not exceed the value set for `cloud_storage_cluster_metadata_upload_interval_ms`. You may consider setting an alert if this remains `0` for longer than 1.5 * `cloud_storage_cluster_metadata_upload_interval_ms` as that may indicate a configuration issue.
