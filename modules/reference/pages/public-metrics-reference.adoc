= Public Metrics Reference
:description: Reference of public metrics to create your system dashboard.

This section provides reference descriptions about the public metrics exported from Redpanda's `/public_metrics` endpoint.

include::shared:partial$metrics-usage-tip.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
In a live system, Redpanda metrics are exported only for features that are in use. For example, a metric for consumer groups is not exported when no groups are registered.

To see the available public metrics in your system, query the `/public_metrics` endpoint:

[,bash]

curl http://<node-addr>:9644/public_metrics | grep "[HELP|TYPE]"

== Cluster metrics

=== redpanda_cluster_brokers

Number of configured, fully commissioned brokers in a cluster.

*Type*: gauge

*How to monitor*: create an alert for when this gauge dips below a steady-state threshold, as a node(s) has become unresponsive.

---

=== redpanda_cluster_controller_log_limit_requests_available_rps

Limit on the available requests per second (RPS) for a cluster controller log.

*Type*: gauge

*Labels*:

* `redpanda_cmd_group=("move_operations" | "topic_operations" | "configuration_operations" | "node_management_operations" | "acls_and_users_operations")`

---

=== redpanda_cluster_controller_log_limit_requests_dropped

Number of requests dropped by a cluster controller log due to exceeding <<redpanda_cluster_controller_log_limit_requests_available_rps,redpanda_cluster_controller_log_limit_requests_available_rps>>.

*Type*: counter

*Labels*:

* `redpanda_cmd_group=("move_operations" | "topic_operations" | "configuration_operations" | "node_management_operations" | "acls_and_users_operations")`

*Usage*: when this counter increases, it indicates that the controller is dropping requests.

---

=== redpanda_cluster_partition_moving_from_node

Number of partition replicas in the cluster that are currently being removed from a node.

*Type*: gauge

*Usage*: when this gauge is non-zero, determine whether there is an expected or unexpected reassignment of partitions that is causing movement of partition replicas.

---

=== redpanda_cluster_partition_moving_to_node

Number of partition replicas in the cluster that are currently being added or moved to a node.

*Type*: gauge

*Usage*: when this gauge is non-zero, determine whether there is an expected or unexpected reassignment of partitions that is causing movement of partition replicas.

---

=== redpanda_cluster_partition_node_cancelling_movements

During a partition movement cancellation operation, the number of partition replicas that were being moved that now need to be cancelled.

*Type*: gauge

*How to monitor*: when this gauge is non-zero, determine whether there is an expected or unexpected reassignment of partitions that is causing movement of partition replicas.

*Usage*: when this gauge is non-zero, it indicates that a partition(s) doesn't have quorum and thus doesn't have an active leader. To mitigate, consider increasing the number of brokers and the partition replication factor.

[[tls_metrics]]
== TLS metrics

=== redpanda_tls_truststore_expires_at_timestamp_seconds

The expiration time, represented as a Unix-style timestamp, of the shortest-lived certificate authority (CA) in the installed CA chain. This lists all resources that have at least one CA configured.

*Type*: gauge

*Labels*:

* `area`
* `detail`

*Usage*: This metric is recorded for all resources that may have a TLS certificate installed. The `area` and `detail` labels provide a hierarchical way of identifying a single resource you need information on.

---

=== redpanda_tls_certificate_expires_at_timestamp_seconds

The expiration time, represented as a Unix-style timestamp, for the shortest-lived installed certificate. While more than one certificate may be installed for a resource, this provides only the timestamp of the next certificate to expire. This lists all resources that have at least one certificate installed.

*Type*: gauge

*Labels*:

* `area`
* `detail`

*Usage*: This metric is recorded for all resources that may have a TLS certificate installed. The `area` and `detail` labels provide a hierarchical way of identifying a single resource you need information on.

---

=== redpanda_tls_certificate_serial

As such, this will return the least significant 4B digits of the integer representation certificate's serial number. While more than one certificate may be installed for a resource, this provides only the serial number of the next certificate to expire. This lists all resources that have at least one certificate installed.

*Type*: gauge

*Labels*:

* `area`
* `detail`

*Usage*: This metric is recorded for all resources that may have a TLS certificate installed. The `area` and `detail` labels provide a hierarchical way of identifying a single resource you need information on.

---

=== redpanda_tls_loaded_at_timestamp_seconds

The last time, represented as a Unix-style timestamp, that at least one TLS certificate was loaded for a resource. This lists all resources that have at least one certificate installed.

*Type*: gauge

*Labels*:

* `area`
* `detail`

*Usage*: This metric is recorded for all resources that may have a TLS certificate installed. The `area` and `detail` labels provide a hierarchical way of identifying a single resource you need information on.

---

=== redpanda_tls_certificate_valid

Indicates whether a given resource has at least one valid installed TLS certificate. Querying this will provide a check on all resources with at least one certificate installed. The value of this gauge is either `1` to indicate presence of a valid certificate or `0` to indicate the absence of a valid certificate.

*Type*: gauge

*Labels*:

* `area`
* `detail`

*Usage*: This metric is recorded for all resources that may have a TLS certificate installed. The `area` and `detail` labels provide a hierarchical way of identifying a single resource you need information on.
