== Cluster metrics

=== redpanda_cluster_brokers

Total number of fully commissioned brokers configured in the cluster.

*Type*: counter

*Labels*:

* `redpanda_cmd_group=("move_operations" | "topic_operations" | "configuration_operations" | "node_management_operations" | "acls_and_users_operations")`

*Usage*: A rising counter indicates that requests are being dropped, which could signal overload or misconfiguration.

=== redpanda_cluster_features_enterprise_license_expiry_sec

Number of seconds remaining until the Enterprise Edition license expires.

*Type*: gauge

*Usage*:

- A value of `0` means that metadata has not yet been uploaded.

- On a healthy system, this age should not exceed the configured value for `cloud_storage_cluster_metadata_upload_interval_ms`.

Consider setting an alert if the age remains `0` for longer than 1.5x the configured interval, as this may indicate a configuration issue.

When performing a whole cluster restore operation, the metadata for the new cluster will not have any changes made to a source cluster that is newer than this age.

*Type*: gauge

*Usage*: On a healthy system, this should not exceed the value set for `cloud_storage_cluster_metadata_upload_interval_ms`. You may consider setting an alert if this remains `0` for longer than 1.5 * `cloud_storage_cluster_metadata_upload_interval_ms` as that may indicate a configuration issue.
