== Cluster metrics

=== redpanda_cluster_brokers

Number of configured, fully commissioned brokers in a cluster.

*Type*: gauge

*How to monitor*: Create an alert for when this gauge dips below a steady-state threshold, as a node(s) has become unresponsive.

---

=== redpanda_cluster_controller_log_limit_requests_available_rps

Limit on the available requests per second (RPS) for a cluster controller log.

*Type*: gauge

*Labels*:

* `redpanda_cmd_group=("move_operations" | "topic_operations" | "configuration_operations" | "node_management_operations" | "acls_and_users_operations")`

---

=== redpanda_cluster_controller_log_limit_requests_dropped

Number of requests dropped by a cluster controller log due to exceeding <<redpanda_cluster_controller_log_limit_requests_available_rps,redpanda_cluster_controller_log_limit_requests_available_rps>>.

*Type*: counter

*Labels*:

* `redpanda_cmd_group=("move_operations" | "topic_operations" | "configuration_operations" | "node_management_operations" | "acls_and_users_operations")`

*Usage*: When this counter increases, it indicates that the controller is dropping requests.

---

=== redpanda_cluster_partition_moving_from_node

Number of partition replicas in the cluster that are currently being removed from a node.

*Type*: gauge

*Usage*: When this gauge is non-zero, determine whether there is an expected or unexpected reassignment of partitions that is causing movement of partition replicas.

---

=== redpanda_cluster_partition_moving_to_node

Number of partition replicas in the cluster that are currently being added or moved to a node.

*Type*: gauge

*Usage*: When this gauge is non-zero, determine whether there is an expected or unexpected reassignment of partitions that is causing movement of partition replicas.

---

=== redpanda_cluster_partition_node_cancelling_movements

During a partition movement cancellation operation, the number of partition replicas that were being moved that now need to be cancelled.

*Type*: gauge

*How to monitor*: When this gauge is non-zero, determine whether there is an expected or unexpected reassignment of partitions that is causing movement of partition replicas.

---

=== redpanda_cluster_partitions

Number of partitions managed by a cluster. Includes partitions of the controller topic, but not replicas.

*Type*: gauge

---

=== redpanda_cluster_topics

Number of topics in a cluster.

*Type*: gauge

---

=== redpanda_cluster_unavailable_partitions

Number of unavailable partitions (the partitions that lack quorum among their replica group) in the cluster.

*Type*: gauge

*Usage*: When this gauge is non-zero, it indicates that a partition(s) doesn't have quorum and thus doesn't have an active leader. To mitigate, consider increasing the number of brokers and the partition replication factor.

---

[[redpanda_cluster_latest_cluster_metadata_manifest_age]]
=== redpanda_cluster_latest_cluster_metadata_manifest_age

The amount of time in seconds since the last time Redpanda uploaded metadata files to Tiered Storage for your cluster. A value of `0` indicates metadata has not yet been uploaded.

When performing a whole cluster restore operation, the metadata for the new cluster will not have any changes made to a source cluster that is newer than this age.

*Type*: gauge

*Usage*: On a healthy system, this should not exceed the value set for `cloud_storage_cluster_metadata_upload_interval_ms`. You may consider setting an alert if this remains `0` for longer than 1.5 * `cloud_storage_cluster_metadata_upload_interval_ms` as that may indicate a configuration issue.
