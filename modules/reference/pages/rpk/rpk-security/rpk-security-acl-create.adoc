Create ACLs.

Following the multiplying effect of combining flags, the create command works on a
straightforward basis: every ACL combination is a created ACL.

As mentioned in the `rpk acl` help text, if no host is specified, an allowed
principal is allowed access from all hosts. The wildcard principal `*` allows
all principals. At least one principal, one host, one resource, and one
operation is required to create a single ACL.

== Examples

Allow all permissions to user bar on topic `foo` and group `g`:

```bash
rpk acl create --allow-principal bar --operation all --topic foo --group g
```

Allow read permissions to all users on topics biz and baz:

```bash
rpk acl create --allow-principal * --operation read --topic biz,baz
```

Allow write permissions to user buzz to transactional ID `txn`:

```bash
rpk acl create --allow-principal User:buzz --operation write --transactional-id txn
```

Allow all permissions to role bar on topic "foo" and group "g":

```bash
--allow-role bar --operation all --topic foo --group g
```
