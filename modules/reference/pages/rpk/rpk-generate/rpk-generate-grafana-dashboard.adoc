= rpk generate grafana-dashboard

Generate Grafana dashboards for Redpanda metrics.

Use this command to generate sample Grafana dashboards for Redpanda metrics.
These dashboards can be imported into a Grafana or Grafana Cloud instance.

To select a specific dashboard, use the `--dashboard` flag followed by the
dashboard name. For example, to generate the operations dashboard, run:

[,bash]
----
rpk generate grafana-dashboard --dashboard operations
----

The selected dashboard will be downloaded from Redpanda Data's https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability[observability GitHub repository^].

NOTE: The legacy dashboard is still available as an option (`legacy`), but it isn't downloaded from GitHub. Instead, the generated dashboard is based on which metrics endpoint is used (`--metrics-endpoint`).

== Available dashboards

You can select one of the following dashboard types:
