= rpk generate shell-completion

Shell completion can help autocomplete `rpk` commands when you press tab.

== Bash

Bash autocompletion relies on the bash-completion package. You can test if you
have this by running `type \_init_completion`, if you do not, you can install
the package through your package manager.

If you have bash-completion installed, and the command still fails, you likely
need to add the following line to your `~/.bashrc`:

[,bash]
----
source /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
----

To ensure autocompletion of `rpk` exists in all shell sessions, add the following
to your `~/.bashrc`:

[,bash]
----
command -v rpk >/dev/null && . <(rpk generate shell-completion bash)
----

Alternatively, to globally enable `rpk` completion, you can run the following:

[,bash]
----
rpk generate shell-completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/rpk
----

== Zsh

To enable autocompletion in any zsh session for any user, run this once:

[,bash]
----
rpk generate shell-completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_rpk"
----

You can also place that command in your `~/.zshrc` to ensure that when you update
`rpk`, you update autocompletion. If you initially require `sudo` to edit that
file, you can `chmod` it to be world writeable, after which you will always be
able to update it from `~/.zshrc`.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your zsh environment, also
add the following to your `~/.zshrc`:

[,zsh]
----
autoload -U compinit; compinit
----

== Fish

To enable autocompletion in any `fish` session, run:

[,fish]
----
rpk generate shell-completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/rpk.fish
----

== Usage

[,bash]
----
rpk generate shell-completion [flags]
----
