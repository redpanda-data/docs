= rpk generate app

Generate a sample application to connect with Redpanda.

This command generates a starter application to produce and consume from the
settings defined in the `rpk profile`. Its goal is to get you producing and
consuming quickly with Redpanda in a language that is familiar to you.

By default, this will run interactively, prompting you to select a language and
a user with which to create your application. To use this without interactivity,
specify how you would like your application to be created using flags.

The `--language` option allows you to specify the language. There is no default.

The `--new-sasl--user` flag allows you to generate a new SASL user
with admin ACLs. If you don't want to use your current profile user or don't want to create a
new one, you can use the `--no-user` flag to generate the starter app without the user.

If you are having trouble connecting to your cluster, you can use the common xref:reference:rpk/rpk-x-options.adoc#adminhosts[`-X admin.hosts=<host:ports>`] flag to pass a specific Admin API address.
