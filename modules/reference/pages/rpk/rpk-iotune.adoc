= rpk iotune
:description: This command measures the I/O performance of the hardware used by a Redpanda instance.

`rpk iotune` measures the I/O performance of the hardware used by a Redpanda instance. It writes its parameters to an I/O configuration file that Redpanda reads on startup to optimize its I/O performance. Its benchmarks measure read/write IOPS and bandwidth.

By default `rpk iotune` writes its output parameters to `/etc/redpanda/io-config.yaml`.

|*Value* |*Type* |*Description*

|--directories |strings |List of directories to evaluate.

|--duration |duration |Duration of tests.The value passed is a sequence
of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such
as `300ms`, `1.5s` or `2h45m`. Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or
`Âµs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h` (default 10m0s).

|-h, --help |- |Help for iotune.

|--no-confirm |- |Disable confirmation prompt if the iotune file already
exists.

|--out |string |The file path where the IO config will be written
(default "/etc/redpanda/io-config.yaml").

|--timeout |duration |The maximum time after -- to wait for iotune to
complete (e.g. 300ms, 1.5s, 2h45m) (default 1h0m0s).

|--config |string |Redpanda or `rpk` config file. Default search paths are: 
`~/.config/rpk/rpk.yaml`, `$PWD`, and `/etc/redpanda/redpanda.yaml`.

|-X, --config-opt |stringArray |Override `rpk` configuration settings. See xref:reference:rpk/rpk-x-options.adoc[`rpk -X`] or execute `rpk -X help` for inline detail or `rpk -X list` for terser detail.

|--profile |string |Profile to use. See xref:reference:rpk/rpk-profile.adoc[`rpk profile`] for more details.

|-v, --verbose |- |Enable verbose logging.
