= rpk shadow delete

Delete a Redpanda Shadow Link.

This command deletes a Shadow Link by name. By default, you cannot delete a Shadow Link that has active shadow topics. Use xref:reference:rpk/rpk-shadow/rpk-shadow-failover.adoc[`rpk shadow failover`] first to deactivate topics before deletion, or use the `--force` flag to delete the Shadow Link and failover all its active shadow topics. 

The command prompts you to confirm the deletion. Use the `--no-confirm` flag to skip the confirmation prompt. The `--force` flag automatically disables the confirmation prompt.

WARNING: Deleting a Shadow Link with `--force` permanently removes all shadow topics and stops replication. This operation cannot be undone.

== Usage

----

== Examples

Delete a Shadow Link:

[,bash]
----
