= rpk shadow failover

Failover a Redpanda Shadow Link.

This command performs a failover operation for a Shadow Link. Failover converts shadow topics into regular topics on the destination cluster, allowing producers and consumers to interact with them directly. After failover, the Shadow Link stops replicating data from the source cluster.

Use the `--all` flag to failover all shadow topics associated with the Shadow Link, or use the --topic flag to failover a specific topic. You must specify either --all or --topic.

The command prompts you to confirm the failover operation. Use the `--no-confirm` flag to skip the confirmation prompt.

WARNING: Failover is a critical operation. After failover, shadow topics become regular topics and replication stops. Ensure your applications are ready to connect to the destination cluster before performing a failover.
