= rpk connect studio pull

Run deployments configured within a Redpanda Connect session.

When a Studio session has one or more deployments added, this command synchronizes with the session and obtains a deployment assignment. The assigned deployment then determines which configs from the session to download and execute.

When changes are made to files of an assigned deployment, or when a new deployment is assigned, this service automatically downloads the new config files and executes them, replacing the previous running stream.

== Usage

|*Value* |*Type* |*Description*

|--session, -s |- | The session ID to synchronize with.

|--name |- | An explicit name to adopt in this instance, used to identify its connection to the session. Each running node must have a unique name. If left unset, a name is generated each time the command is run.

|--token, -h      |- | A token for the session, used to authenticate requests. If left blank, the environment variable `BSTDIO_NODE_TOKEN` is used.

|--token-secret     |- | A token secret the session, used to authenticate requests. If left blank, the environment variable `BSTDIO_NODE_SECRET` is used.

|--send-traces      |- | Whether to send trace data back to Studio during execution. This is an opt-in way to add trace events to the graph editor for testing and debugging configs. This is a very useful feature, but use it with caution, because it exports information about messages passing through the stream (default: false). 

|--help, -h      |- | Show help.
