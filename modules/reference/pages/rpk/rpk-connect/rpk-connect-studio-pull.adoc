= rpk connect studio pull

Run deployments configured within a Redpanda Connect session.

When a Studio session has one or more deployments added this command will synchronize with the session and obtain a deployment assignment. The assigned deployment will then determine which configs from the session to download and execute.

When either changes are made to files of an assigned deployment, or when a new deployment is assigned, this service will automatically download the new config files and execute them, replacing the previous stream running.

|*Value* |*Type* |*Description*

|--session, -s |- | The session ID to synchronize with.

|--name |- | An explicit name to adopt in this instance, used to identify its connection to the session. Each running node must have a unique name, if left unset a name is generated each time the command is run.

|--token, -h      |- | A token for the session, used to authenticate requests. If left blank the environment variable `BSTDIO_NODE_TOKEN` will be used instead.

|--token-secret     |- | A token secret the session, used to authenticate requests. If left blank the environment variable `BSTDIO_NODE_SECRET` will be used instead.

|--send-traces      |- | Whether to send trace data back to Studio during execution. This is opt-in and is used as a way to add trace events to the graph editor for testing and debugging configs. This is a very useful feature but should be used with caution as it exports information about messages passing through the stream (default: false). 

|--help, -h      |- | Show help.
