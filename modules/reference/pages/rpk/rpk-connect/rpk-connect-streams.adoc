= rpk connect streams

Run Redpanda Connect in streams mode, where multiple pipelines can be executed in a single process and can be created, updated, and removed with REST HTTP endpoints. In streams mode, the stream fields of a root target config (input, buffer, pipeline, output) is ignored. Other fields are shared across all loaded streams (resources, metrics, etc.).
