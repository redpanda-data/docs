Manage ACLs and SASL users.

These commands let you create SASL users and create, list, and delete ACLs. The help text below is specific to ACLs. To learn about SASL users,
see the help text under the `user` command.

When using SASL, ACLs allow or deny you access to certain requests. The
`create`, `delete`, and `list` commands help you manage your ACLs.

An ACL is made up of five components:

* a principal (the user)
* a host the principal is allowed or denied requests from
* what resource to access (topic name, group ID, etc.)
* the operation (read, write, etc.)
* the permission (whether to allow or deny the above)

ACL commands work on a multiplicative basis. If creating, specifying two
principals and two permissions creates four ACLs: both permissions for the
first principal, as well as both permissions for the second principal. Adding
two resources further doubles the ACLs created.

It is recommended to be as specific as possible when granting ACLs. Granting
more ACLs than necessary per principal may inadvertently allow clients to do
things they should not, such as deleting topics or joining the wrong consumer
group.

== Principals

All ACLs require a principal. A principal is composed of two parts: the type
and the name. Within Redpanda, only one type is supported, `User`. The reason
for the prefix is that a potential future authorizer may add support for
authorizing by Group or anything else.

When you create a user, you need to add ACLs for it before it can be used. You
can create/delete/list ACLs for that user with either `User:bar` or `bar`
in the `--allow-principal` and `--deny-principal` flags. This command will add the
`User:` prefix for you if it is missing. The wildcard pass:q[`*`] matches any user.
Creating an ACL with user `*` grants or denies the permission for all users.

== Hosts

Hosts can be seen as an extension of the principal, and effectively gate where
the principal can connect from. When creating ACLs, unless otherwise specified,
the default host is the wildcard `*` which allows or denies the principal from
all hosts (where allow & deny are based on whether `--allow-principal` or
`--deny-principal` is used). If specifying hosts, you must pair the `--allow-host`
flag with the `--allow-principal` flag, and the `--deny-host` flag with the
`--deny-principal` flag.

== Resources

A resource is what an ACL allows or denies access to. There are four resources
within Redpanda: topics, groups, the cluster itself, and transactional IDs.
Names for each of these resources can be specified with their respective flags.

Resources combine with the operation that is allowed or denied on that
resource. The next section describes which operations are required for which
requests, and further fleshes out the concept of a resource.

By default, resources are specified on an exact name match (a `literal` match).
The --resource-pattern-type flag can be used to specify that a resource name is
`prefixed`, meaning to allow anything with the given prefix. A literal name of
`foo` will match only the topic `foo`, while the prefixed name of `foo-` will
match both `foo-bar` and `foo-baz`. The special wildcard resource name pass:q[`*`]
matches any name of the given resource type (--topic `*` matches all topics).

== Operations

Pairing with resources, operations are the actions that are allowed or denied.
Redpanda has the following operations:


[cols=",",]
|===
|*Operation* |*Description*

|`all` |Allows all operations below.
|`read` |Allows reading a given resource.
|`write` |Allows writing to a given resource.
|`create` |Allows creating a given resource.
|`delete` |Allows deleting a given resource.
|`alter` |Allows altering non-configurations.
|`describe` |Allows querying non-configurations.
|`describe_configs` |Allows describing configurations.
|`alter_configs` |Allows altering configurations.
|===


You can run `rpk acl --help-operations` to see which operations are required for which
requests. In flag form to set up a general producing/consuming client, you can
invoke `rpk acl create` three times with the following (including your
`--allow-principal`):

`rpk acl create --operation write,read,describe --topic [topics] `

`rpk acl create --operation describe,read --group [group.id]`

`rpk acl create --operation describe,write --transactional-id [transactional.id]`

== Permissions

A client can be allowed access or denied access. By default, all permissions
are denied. You only need to specifically deny a permission if you allow a wide
set of permissions and then want to deny a specific permission in that set.
You could allow all operations, and then specifically deny writing to topics.

== Management

Creating ACLs works on a specific ACL basis, but listing and deleting ACLs
works on filters. Filters allow matching many ACLs to be printed listed and
deleted at once. Because this can be risky for deleting, the delete command
prompts for confirmation by default. More details and examples for creating,
listing, and deleting can be seen in each of the commands.

Using SASL requires setting `enable_sasl: true` in the redpanda section of your
`redpanda.yaml`. User management is a separate, simpler concept that is
described in the user command.
