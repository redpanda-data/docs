= rpk acl create

Create ACLs.

Following the multiplying effect of combining flags, the create command works on a
straightforward basis: every ACL combination is a created ACL.

As mentioned in the `rpk acl` help text, if no host is specified, an allowed
principal is allowed access from all hosts. The wildcard principal `*` allows
all principals. At least one principal, one host, one resource, and one
operation is required to create a single ACL.

Allow all permissions to user bar on topic `foo` and group `g`:

`rpk acl create --allow-principal bar --operation all --topic foo --group g`

Allow read permissions to all users on topics biz and baz:

`rpk acl create --allow-principal * --operation read --topic biz,baz`

Allow write permissions to user buzz to transactional id `txn`:

`rpk acl create --allow-principal User:buzz --operation write --transactional-id txn`
