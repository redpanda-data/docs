= rpk cluster config import

CAUTION: Redpanda does not support importing cluster-specific identification (such as `cluster_id`) with this command.

Import cluster configuration from a file.

Import configuration from a YAML file, usually generated with
corresponding `export` command. This downloads the current cluster
configuration, calculates the difference with the YAML file, and
updates any properties that were changed. If a property is removed
from the YAML file, it is reset to its default value.

== Usage

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster config import [flags]
