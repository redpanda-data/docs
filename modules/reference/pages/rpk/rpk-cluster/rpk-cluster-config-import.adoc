= rpk cluster config import

CAUTION: Redpanda does not support importing cluster-specific identification (such as `cluster_id`) with this command.

Import cluster configuration from a file.

This command imports a cluster configuration from a YAML file, typically generated with the `export` command. The command first retrieves the current cluster configuration, compares it with the specified YAML file, and then updates any properties that were changed. If a property exists in the current configuration but is absent from the YAML file, that property is reset to its default value.

== Usage

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster config import [flags]
