[NOTE]
====
Setting parameters to non-number values (such as string values with a `-`) can be problematic for some terminals due to how POSIX flags are parsed from the command. For example, this command may not work from some terminals:

```
rpk cluster config set delete_retention_ms -1
```

This can be resolved by using an alternate syntax that includes a `--` to disable parsing for all subsequent characters:

```
rpk cluster config set -- delete_retention_ms -1
```
