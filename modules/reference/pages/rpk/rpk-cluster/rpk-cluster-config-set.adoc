= rpk cluster config set

Set a single cluster configuration property.

This command is provided for use in scripts. For interactive editing, or bulk
changes, use the `edit` and `import` commands respectively.

You may also use `<key>=<value>` notation for setting configuration properties:

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster config set log_retention_ms=-1
----

If an empty string is given as the value, the property is reset to its default.

== Usage

[NOTE]
====
Setting properties to non-number values (such as setting string values with `-`) can be problematic for some terminals due to how POSIX flags are parsed. For example, the following command may not work from some terminals:

```
rpk cluster config set delete_retention_ms -1
```

Workaround: Use `--` to disable parsing for all subsequent characters. For example:

```
rpk cluster config set -- delete_retention_ms -1
```
