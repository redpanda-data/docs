= rpk cluster partitions unsafe-recover

Recover unsafely from partitions that have lost majority.

IMPORTANT: This operation is unsafe because it allows the forced leader election of the partitions that have lost majority when nodes are gone and irrecoverable; this may result in data loss.

This command allows you to unsafely recover all data adversely affected by the loss of the nodes specified in the `--from-nodes` flag. 

You can perform a dry run and verify the partitions that will be recovered by using the `--dry` flag.
