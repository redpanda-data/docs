= rpk cluster self-test start
:description: Reference for the 'rpk cluster self-test start' command. Starts one or more benchmark tests on one or more nodes of the cluster.

Starts one or more benchmark tests on one or more nodes of the cluster.

NOTE: Redpanda self-test runs benchmarks of disk and network hardware that will consume significant system resources. Do not start self-test if large workloads are already running on the system. 

Available tests to run:

* *Disk tests*
** Throughput test: 512 KB messages, sequential read/write
*** Uses a larger request message sizes and deeper I/O queue depth to write/read more bytes in a shorter amount of time, at the cost of IOPS/latency.
** Latency test: 4 KB messages, sequential read/write
*** Uses smaller request message sizes and lower levels of parallelism to achieve higher IOPS and lower latency.
* *Network tests*
** Throughput test: 8192-bit messages
*** Unique pairs of Redpanda nodes each act as a client and a server.
*** The test pushes as much data over the wire, within the test parameters.
* *Cloud storage tests*
** Latency test: 1024-bit object.
** Depending on cluster read/write permissions (xref:reference:properties/object-storage-properties.adoc#cloud_storage_enable_remote_read[`cloud_storage_enable_remote_read`], xref:reference:properties/object-storage-properties.adoc#cloud_storage_enable_remote_write[`cloud_storage_enable_remote_write`]), a series of cloud storage operations are performed:
*** Upload an object to an object storage.
*** List objects in the object storage.
*** Download an object from the object storage.
*** Delete the original object from the object storage, if it was uploaded.

This command asks for users confirmation (unless when the flag `--no-confirm` is used.), then returns with a test identifier ID, and starts to run the tests run. To see the status and the results pool with the xref:./rpk-cluster-self-test-status.adoc[rpk cluster self-test status]
