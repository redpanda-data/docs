= rpk cluster self-test start
:description: Reference for the 'rpk cluster self-test start' command. Starts one or more benchmark tests on one or more nodes of the cluster.
:rpk_version: v23.2.1

Starts one or more benchmark tests on one or more nodes of the cluster.

Available tests to run:

* *Disk tests*
** Throughput test: 512 KB messages, sequential read/write
*** Uses a larger request message sizes and deeper I/O queue depth to write/read more bytes in a shorter amount of time, at the cost of IOPS/latency.
** Latency test: 4 KB messages, sequential read/write
*** Uses smaller request message sizes and lower levels of parallelism to achieve higher IOPS and lower latency.
* *Network tests*
** Throughput test: 8192-bit messages
*** Unique pairs of Redpanda nodes each act as a client and a server.
*** The test pushes as much data over the wire, within the test parameters.

This command immediately returns on success, and the tests run asynchronously. The
user polls for results with the xref:./rpk-cluster-self-test-status.adoc[rpk cluster self-test status]
command.
