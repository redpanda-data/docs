= rpk cluster self-test start
:description: Reference for the 'rpk cluster self-test start' command. Starts one or more benchmark tests on one or more nodes of the cluster.

Starts one or more benchmark tests on one or more nodes of the cluster.

NOTE: Redpanda self-test runs benchmarks that consume significant system resources. Do not start self-test if large workloads are already running on the system. 

Available tests to run:

* *Disk tests*
** Throughput test: 512 KB messages, sequential read/write
*** Uses a larger request message sizes and deeper I/O queue depth to write/read more bytes in a shorter amount of time, at the cost of IOPS/latency.
** Latency test: 4 KB messages, sequential read/write
*** Uses smaller request message sizes and lower levels of parallelism to achieve higher IOPS and lower latency.
* *Network tests*
** Throughput test: 8192-bit messages
*** Unique pairs of Redpanda nodes each act as a client and a server.
*** The test pushes as much data over the wire, within the test parameters.
* *Cloud storage tests*
** Latency test: 1024-bit object.
** Depending on cluster read/write permissions (xref:reference:properties/object-storage-properties.adoc#cloud_storage_enable_remote_read[`cloud_storage_enable_remote_read`], xref:reference:properties/object-storage-properties.adoc#cloud_storage_enable_remote_write[`cloud_storage_enable_remote_write`]), a series of cloud storage operations are performed:
*** Upload an object to an object storage.
*** List objects in the object storage.
*** Download an object from the object storage.
*** Delete the original object from the object storage, if it was uploaded.

This command prompts users for confirmation (unless the flag `--no-confirm` is specified), then returns a test identifier ID, and runs the tests.

To view the test status, poll xref:./rpk-cluster-self-test-status.adoc[rpk cluster self-test status]. Once the tests end, the cached results will be available with `rpk cluster self-test status`.
