= rpk cluster partitions transfer-leadership

Transfer partition leadership between brokers.

You can transfer only one partition leader at a time.

WARNING: Redpanda tries to balance leadership distribution across brokers by default. If the distribution of leaders becomes uneven as a result of transferring leadership across brokers, the cluster may move leadership back to the original brokers automatically.

== Usage

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster partitions transfer-leadership [flags]
----

== Examples

Transfer partition leadership:

```bash
rpk cluster partitions transfer-leadership foo --partition 0:2
```

The preceding example shows how to transfer leadership for the partition `kafka/foo/0` to broker 2. By default, it uses the `kafka` namespace, but you can specify an internal namespace using the `{namespace}/` prefix.

Equivalent command using different syntax:

```bash
rpk cluster partitions transfer-leadership --partition foo/0:2
```
