= rpk cluster partitions transfer-leadership

Transfer partition leadership between brokers. This command supports transferring only one partition leader at a time.

NOTE: Redpanda tries to balance leadership distribution across brokers by default.
If the distribution of leaders becomes uneven as a result of transferring leadership
across brokers, the cluster may move leadership back to the original
brokers automatically.

== Usage

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster partitions transfer-leadership [flags]
----

== Examples

To transfer partition leadership for a partition `0` to a broker ID `2`, run:

```bash
rpk cluster partitions transfer-leadership foo --partition 0:2
```

The `--partition` flag accepts a value `<A>:<B>`, where `A` is a topic-partition and `B` is the ID of the broker to which you want to transfer leadership. To specify a topic-partition, you can use just the partition ID (`0`) or also use the topic name together with the partition using the following syntax:

```bash
rpk cluster partitions transfer-leadership --partition test-topic/0:2
```

In this case, the name of the topic is `test-topic` and the partition ID is `0`.

The preceding examples transfer leadership for the partition `kafka/test-topic/0`. The command behavior is based on the assumption that the default namespace is `kafka`, but you can also specify an internal namespace using the `+{namespace}/+` prefix.
