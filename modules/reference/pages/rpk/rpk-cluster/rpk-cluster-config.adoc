// tag::single-source[]

Interact with cluster configuration properties.

Cluster properties are Redpanda settings that apply to all brokers in
the cluster.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Cluster properties are Redpanda settings that apply to all brokers in
the cluster. These are separate from broker properties, which apply to only that broker and are set with
`rpk redpanda config`.

Use the `edit` subcommand to interactively modify the cluster configuration, or
`export` and `import` to write the configuration to a file that can be edited and
read back later.

These commands take an optional `--all` flag to include all properties such as
low-level tunables (for example, internal buffer sizes) that do not usually need
to be changed during normal operations. These properties generally require
some expertise to set safely, so if in doubt, avoid using `--all`.
endif::[]

Modified properties are propagated immediately to all brokers. Use the `status`
subcommand to verify that all brokers are up to date and identify
any settings which were rejected by a broker; for example, if the broker is running a
different Redpanda version that does not recognize certain properties.
