= rpk cluster config status

Get configuration status of redpanda nodes.

For each node, indicate whether a restart is required for settings to
take effect, and any settings that the node has identified as invalid
or unknown properties.

Additionally show the version of cluster configuration that each node
has applied: under normal circumstances these should all be equal,
a lower number shows that a node is out of sync, perhaps because it
is offline.
