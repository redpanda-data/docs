= rpk cluster config status
// tag::single-source[]

Get configuration status of Redpanda brokers.

For each broker, the command output indicates whether a restart is required for settings to
take effect, and any settings that the broker has identified as invalid
or unknown.

The command also returns the version of cluster configuration that each broker
has applied. The version should be the same across all brokers and
it is incremented each time a configuration change is applied to the
cluster. If a broker is using an earlier version as indicated by a lower number,
it may be out of sync with the rest of the cluster. This can happen if a broker
is offline or if it has not yet applied the latest configuration changes.  The cluster configuration version number is not the same as the Redpanda version number.
