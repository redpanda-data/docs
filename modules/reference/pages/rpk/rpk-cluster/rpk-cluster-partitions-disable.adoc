= rpk cluster partitions disable

Disable partitions of a topic.

You may disable all partitions of a topic using the `--all` flag or you may select a set of topic/partitions to disable with the `--partitions` or `-p` flag.

The partition flag accepts the format `<namespace>/<topic>/[partitions...]` where namespace and topic are optional parameters. 

If the namespace is not provided, `rpk` will assume `kafka`. 

If the topic is not provided in the flag, `rpk` will use the topic provided as an argument to this command.


== Disabled Partitions

Disabling a partition in Redpanda involves prohibiting any data consumption or production to and from it. All internal processes associated with the partition are stopped, and it remains unloaded during system startup. 

This measure aims to maintain cluster health by preventing issues caused by specific corrupted partitions that may lead to Redpanda crashes. Although the data remains stored on disk, Redpanda ceases interaction with the disabled partitions to ensure system stability.


== Examples

Disable all partitions in topic `foo`:

```bash
rpk cluster partitions disable foo --all
```

Disable partitions 1,2 and 3 of topic `bar` in the namespace `internal`:

```bash
rpk cluster partitions disable internal/bar --partitions 1,2,3
```

Disable partition 1, and 2 of topic `foo`, and partition 5 of topic `bar` in the `internal` namespace:

```bash
rpk cluster partitions disable -p foo/1,2 -p internal/bar/5
```

== Usage
