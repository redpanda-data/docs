Interact with the topic restoration process.

This command is used to restore topics from the archival bucket, which can be useful for disaster recovery or if a topic was accidentally deleted.

To begin the recovery process, use the `restore start` command. Note that this process can take a while to complete, so the command will exit after starting it. If you want the command to wait for the process to finish, use the `--wait` or `-w` flag.

You can check the status of the recovery process with the `restore status` command after it has been started.
