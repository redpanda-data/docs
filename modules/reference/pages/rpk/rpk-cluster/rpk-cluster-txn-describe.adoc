= rpk cluster txn describe

Describe transactional IDs.

This command, in comparison to `list`, is a more detailed per-transaction view of transactional IDs. In addition to the state and producer ID, this command also outputs when a transaction started, the epoch of the producer ID, how long until the transaction times out, and the partitions currently a part of the transaction. For information on what the columns in the output mean, see `rpk cluster txn --help`.

By default, all topics in a transaction are merged into one line. To print a row per topic, use `--format=long`. To include partitions with topics, use `--print-partitions`; `--format=json/yaml` will return the equivalent of the long format with print partitions included.

If no transactional IDs are requested, all transactional IDs are printed.
