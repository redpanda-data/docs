= rpk cluster storage unmount
// tag::single-source[]

Unmount a topic from the Redpanda cluster and secure it in glossterm:tiered-storage[].

This command performs an operation that:

1. Rejects all writes to the topic.

2. Flushes data to Tiered Storage.

3. Removes the topic from the cluster.

Key Points:

- During unmounting, any attempted writes or reads will receive an `UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION` error.

- The unmount operation works independently of other topic configurations like `remote.delete=false`.

- After unmounting, the topic can be remounted to this cluster or a different cluster if the log segments are moved to that cluster's Tiered Storage.
