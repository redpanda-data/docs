= rpk profile set-globals

Set `rpk` globals fields.

This command takes a list of key=value pairs to write to the global config
section of `rpk.yaml`. The globals section contains a set of settings that apply
to all profiles and changes the way that `rpk` acts. For a list of global flags
and what they mean, see xref:reference:rpk/rpk-x-options.adoc[`rpk -X`] and look for any key that begins with
"globals".

This command supports autocompletion of valid keys. You can also use the
format `set key value` if you intend to only set one key.
