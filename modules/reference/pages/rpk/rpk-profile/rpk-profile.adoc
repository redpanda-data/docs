= rpk profile
:description: pass:q[These commands let you manage `rpk` profiles.] 
:page-aliases: reference:rpk/rpk-profile.adoc

Manage `rpk profiles`.

An `rpk profile` talks to a single Redpanda cluster. You can create multiple
profiles for multiple clusters and swap between them with `rpk profile use`.
Multiple profiles may be useful if, for example, you use `rpk` to talk to
a localhost cluster, a dev cluster, and a prod cluster, and you want to keep
your configuration in one place.
