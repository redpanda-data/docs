= rpk profile create

Create an rpk profile.

There are multiple ways to create a profile. A name must be provided if not using `--from-cloud` or `--from-rpk-container`.

* You can use `--from-redpanda` to generate a new profile from an existing
`redpanda.yaml` file. The special value `current` creates a profile from the
current `redpanda.yaml` as it is loaded within rpk.
* You can use `--from-rpk-container` to generate a profile from an existing cluster created using `rpk container start` command. The name is not needed when using this flag.
* You can use `--from-profile` to generate a profile from an existing profile or
from from a profile in a yaml file. First, the filename is checked, then an
existing profile name is checked. The special value `current` creates a new
profile from the existing profile.
* You can use `--from-cloud` to generate a profile from an existing cloud cluster
ID. Note that you must be logged in with xref:reference:rpk/rpk-cloud/rpk-cloud-login.adoc[`rpk cloud login`] first. The special
value `prompt` will prompt to select a cloud cluster to create a profile for.
* You can use `--set key=value` to directly set fields. The key can either be
the name of a `-X` flag or the path to the field in the profile's YAML format.
For example, using `--set tls.enabled=true` OR `--set kafka_api.tls.enabled=true`
is equivalent. The former corresponds to the `-X` flag `tls.enabled`, while the
latter corresponds to the path `kafka_api.tls.enabled` in the profile's YAML.

The `--set` flag is always applied last and can be used to set additional fields
in tandem with `--from-redpanda` or `--from-cloud`.

The `--set` flag supports autocompletion, suggesting the `-X` key format. If you
begin writing a YAML path, the flag will suggest the rest of the path.

It is recommended to always use the `--description` flag; the description is
printed in the output of xref:./rpk-profile-list.adoc[`rpk profile list`].

Once the command completes successfully, rpk switches to the newly created profile.
