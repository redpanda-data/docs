= rpk cloud logout

Log out from Redpanda cloud.

This command deletes your cloud authentication token. If you want to log out entirely and
switch to a different organization, you can use the `--clear-credentials` flag to
additionally clear your client ID and client secret. You can use the --all flag to log out of all organizations you may be logged into.
