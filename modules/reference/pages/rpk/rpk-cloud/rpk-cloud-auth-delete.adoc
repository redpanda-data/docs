= rpk cloud auth delete
:description: rpk cloud auth delete
:rpk_version: v23.2.1

Delete an rpk cloud authentication (auth).

Deleting a cloud auth removes it from the `rpk.yaml` file. If the deleted
auth was the current auth, rpk will use a default SSO auth the next time
you try to login, and if the login is successful, it will save the auth.

== Usage
