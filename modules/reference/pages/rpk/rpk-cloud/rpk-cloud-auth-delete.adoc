= rpk cloud auth delete

Delete an `rpk` cloud authentication (auth).

Deleting a cloud auth removes it from the `rpk.yaml` file. If the deleted
auth was the current auth, `rpk` will use a default SSO auth the next time
you try to login, and if the login is successful, it will save the auth.

== Usage

[,bash]
----
rpk cloud auth delete [NAME] [flags]
