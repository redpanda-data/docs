:rpk_version: v23.2.1

Produce records to a topic.

Producing records reads from `STDIN`, parses input according to `--format`, and
produce records to Redpanda. The input formatter understands a wide variety of
formats.

Parsing input operates on either sizes or on delimiters, both of which can be
specified in the same formatting options. If using sizes to specify something,
the size must come before what it is specifying. Delimiters match on an exact
text basis. This command will quit with an error if any input fails to match
your specified format.

== Format input

Slashes can be used for common escapes:

[.no-copy]
----
    \t \n \r \\ \xNN
----

matches tabs, newlines, carriage returns, slashes, and hex encoded characters.

Percent encoding reads into specific values of a record:

[.no-copy]
----
    %t    topic
    %T    topic length
    %k    key
    %K    key length
    %v    value
    %V    value length
    %h    begin the header specification
    %H    number of headers
    %p    partition (if using the --partition flag)
----

Three escapes exist to parse characters that are used to modify the previous
escapes:

[.no-copy]
----
    %%    percent sign
    %{    left brace
    %}    right brace
----

=== Modifiers

Text and numbers can be read in multiple formats, and the default format can be
changed within brace modifiers. %v reads a value, while %v\{hex} reads a value
and then hex decodes it before producing. %T reads the length of a topic from
the input, while %T\{3} reads exactly three bytes for a topic from the input.

All modifiers go within braces following a percent-escape.

=== Numbers

Reading number values can have the following modifiers:

[.no-copy]
----
     ascii       parse numeric digits until a non-numeric (default)

     hex64       sixteen hex characters
     hex32       eight hex characters
     hex16       four hex characters
     hex8        two hex characters
     hex4        one hex character

     big64       eight byte big endian number
     big32       four byte big endian number
     big16       two byte big endian number
     big8        alias for byte

     little64    eight byte little endian number
     little32    four byte little endian number
     little16    two byte little endian number
     little8     alias for byte

     byte        one byte number
     <digits>    directly specify the length as this many digits
     bool        read "true" as 1, "false" as 0
----

When reading number sizes, the size corresponds to the size of the encoded
values, not the decoded values. "%T\{6}%t\{hex}" will read six hex bytes and
decode into three.

=== Text

Reading text values can have the following modifiers:

[.no-copy]
----
    hex       read text then hex decode it
    base64    read text then std-encoding base64 decode it
    re        read text matching a regular expression
----

=== Headers

Headers are parsed with an internal key / value specifier format. For example,
the following will read three headers that begin and end with a space and are
separated by an equal:

[.no-copy]
----
    %H{3}%h{ %k=%v }
----

=== Examples

In the below examples, we can parse many records at once. The produce command
reads input and tokenizes based on your specified format. Every time the format
is completely matched, a record is produced and parsing begins anew.

* A key and value, separated by a space and ending in newline:
`-f '%k %v\n'`
* A four byte topic, four byte key, and four byte value:
`+-f '%T{4}%K{4}%V{4}%t%k%v'+`
* A value to a specific partition, if using a non-negative --partition flag:
`-f '%p %v\n'`
* A big-endian uint16 key size, the text " foo ", and then that key:
`+-f '%K{big16} foo %k'+`
* A value that can be two or three characters followed by a newline:
`+-f '%v{re#...?#}\n'+`

=== Miscellaneous

Producing requires a topic to produce to. The topic can be specified either
directly on as an argument, or in the input text through %t. A parsed topic
takes precedence over the default passed in topic. If no topic is specified
directly and no topic is parsed, this command will quit with an error.

The input format can parse partitions to produce directly to with %p. Doing so
requires specifying a non-negative --partition flag. Any parsed partition
takes precedence over the --partition flag; specifying the flag is the main
requirement for being able to directly control which partition to produce to.

You can also specify an output format to write when a record is produced
successfully. The output format follows the same formatting rules as the topic
consume command. See that command's help text for a detailed description.

== Usage

[,bash]
----
rpk topic produce [TOPIC] [flags]
----

== Flags

[cols="1m,1a,2a"]
|===
|*Value* |*Type* |*Description*

|--acks |int |Number of acks required for producing (-1=all, 0=none,
1=leader) (default -1).

|--allow-auto-topic-creation |- |Auto-create non-existent topics;
requires auto_create_topics_enabled on the broker.

|-z, --compression |string |Compression to use for producing batches
(none, gzip, snappy, lz4, zstd) (default "snappy").

|--delivery-timeout |duration |Per-record delivery timeout, if non-zero,
min 1s.

|-f, --format |string |Input record format (default "%v\n").

|-H, --header |stringArray |Headers in format key:value to add to each
record (repeatable).

|-h, --help |- |Help for produce.

|-k, --key |string |A fixed key to use for each record (parsed input
keys take precedence).

|--max-message-bytes |int32 |If non-negative, maximum size of a record
batch before compression (default -1).

|-o, --output-format |string |what to write to stdout when a record is
successfully produced (default "Produced to partition %p at offset %o
with timestamp %d.\n").

|-p, --partition |int32 |Partition to directly produce to, if
non-negative (also allows %p parsing to set partitions) (default -1).
