= rpk topic
:description: rpk topic

You can use `rpk topic` to manage your topics, create new messages and consume them.

== Formatting

Formatting is based on percent escapes and modifiers. Slashes can be
used for common escapes:

[cols=",",]
|===
|Escape |Description
|` \t ` |Tabs.
|`\n` |Newlines
|`\r` |Carriage returns.
|`\\` |Slashes.
|`\xNN` |Hex encoded characters.
|===


The percent encodings are represented like this:

[cols=",",]
|===
|Percent encoding |Description
|`%t` |Topic.
|`%T` |Topic length.
|`%k` |Key.
|`%K` |Key length.
|`%v` |Value.
|`%V` |Value length.
|`%h` |Begin the header specification.
|`%H` |Number of headers.
|`%p` |Partition.
|`%o` |Offset.
|`%e` |Leader epoch.
|`%d` |Timestamp (formatting described below).
|`%x` |Producer id.
|`%y` |Producer epoch.
|`%[` |Partition log start offset.
|`%|` |Partition last stable offset.
|`%]` |Partition high watermark.
|`%%` |Percent sign
|`%{` |Left brace.
|%} |Right brace.
|%i |The number of records formatted.
|===

=== Modifiers

Text and numbers can be formatted in many different ways, and the default
format can be changed within brace modifiers. `%v` prints a value, while `%v\{hex}`
prints the value hex encoded. `%T` prints the length of a topic in ascii, while
`%T\{big8}` prints the length of the topic as an eight byte big endian.

All modifiers go within braces following a percent-escape.

=== Numbers

Formatting number values can have the following modifiers:

[cols=",",]
|===
|Format |Description
|`ascii` |Print the number as ascii (default).
|`hex64` |Sixteen hex characters.
|`hex32` |Eight hex characters.
|`hex16` |Four hex characters.
|`hex8` |Two hex characters.
|`hex4` |One hex character.
|`big64` |Eight byte big endian number.
|`big32` |Four byte big endian number.
|`big16` |Two byte big endian number.
|`big8` |Alias for byte.
|`little64` |Eight byte little endian number
|`little32` |Four byte little endian number.
|`little16` |Two byte little endian number.
|`little8` |Alias for byte.
|`byte` |One byte number.
|===

All numbers are truncated as necessary per the modifier. Printing `%V\{byte}` for
a length 256 value will print a single null, whereas printing `%V\{big8}` would
print the bytes 1 and 0.

When writing number sizes, the size corresponds to the size of the raw values,
not the size of encoded values. `%T% t\{hex}` for the topic `foo` will print
`3 666f6f`, not `6 666f6f`.

=== Timestamps

By default, the timestamp field is printed as a millisecond number value. In
addition to the number modifiers above, timestamps can be printed with either
`Go` formatting:

```go
%d{go[2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00]}
```

Or `strftime` formatting:

```go
%d{strftime[%F]}
```

An arbitrary amount of brackets (or braces, or # symbols) can wrap your date
formatting:

```go
%d{strftime### [%F] ###}
```

The above will print `[YYYY-MM-DD]`, while the surrounding three # on each
side are used to wrap the formatting.

Further details on Go time formatting can
be found at [Go's time documentation website](https://pkg.go.dev/time).

Further details on `strftime`
formatting can be read by running `man strftime`.

=== Text

Text fields without modifiers default to writing the raw bytes. Alternatively,
there are the following modifiers:

[cols=",",]
|===
|Modifier |Description

|`%t\{hex}` |Hex encoding

|`%k\{base64}` |Base64 encoding

|`%v{unpack[<bBhH>iIqQc.$]}` |The unpack modifier has a further internal
specification, similar to timestamps above.
|===

The hex modifier hex encodes the text, and the base64 modifier base64 encodes
the text with standard encoding. The unpack modifier has a further internal
specification, similar to timestamps above:

[cols=",",]
|===
|Character |Description

|`x` |Pad character (does not parse input).

|`<` |Switch what follows to little endian.

|`>` |Switch what follows to big endian.

|`b` |Signed byte.

|`B` |Unsigned byte.

|`h` |int16 ("half word").

|`H` |uint16 ("half word").

|`i` |int32.

|`I` |uint32.

|`q` |int64 ("quad word").

|`Q` |uint64 ("quad word").

|`c` |Any character.

|`.` |Alias for c.

|`s` |Consume the rest of the input as a string
