:description: pass:q[These commands let you list, download, update, and remove `rpk` plugins.]
:page-aliases: reference:rpk/rpk-plugin.adoc

List, download, update, and remove `rpk` plugins.
Plugins augment `rpk` with new commands.

For a plugin to be used, it must be in `$HOME/.local/bin` or somewhere
discoverable by `rpk` in your `$PATH`. All plugins follow a defined naming scheme:

[,bash]
----
.rpk-|name|
.rpk.ac-|name|
----

All plugins are prefixed with either `.rpk-` or `.rpk.ac-.` When `rpk` starts up, it
searches all directories in your `$PATH` for any executable binary that begins
with either of those prefixes. For any binary it finds, `rpk` adds a command for
that name to the `rpk` command space itself.

No plugin name can shadow an existing `rpk` command, and only one plugin can
exist under a given name at once. Plugins are added to the `rpk` command space on
a first-seen basis. If you have two plugins `rpk-foo`, and the second is
discovered later on in the `$PATH` directories, then only the first will be used.
The second will be ignored.

Plugins that have an `.rpk.ac-` prefix indicate that they support the
`--help-autocomplete` flag. If `rpk` sees this, `rpk` will exec the plugin with that
flag when `rpk` starts up, and the plugin will return all commands it supports as
well as short and long help test for each command. `rpk` uses this return to
build a shadow command space within `rpk` itself so that it looks as if the
plugin exists within `rpk`. This is particularly useful if you enable
autocompletion.

The expected return for plugins from `--help-autocomplete` is an array of the
following:

[,c]
----
type pluginHelp struct {
Path string `json:"path,omitempty"`
Short string `json:"short,omitempty"`
Long string `json:"long,omitempty"`
Example string `json:"example,omitempty"`
Args []string `json:"args,omitempty"`
}
----

where `path` is an underscore delimited argument path to a command. For
example, `foo_bar_baz` corresponds to the command `rpk foo bar baz`.

== Usage
