= rpk plugin list

List all available plugins.

By default, this command fetches the remote manifest and prints plugins
available for download. Any plugin that is already downloaded is prefixed with
an asterisk. If a locally installed plugin has a different `SHA-256 SUM` as the one
specified in the manifest, or if the `SHA-256 SUM` could not be calculated for the
local plugin, an additional message is printed.

You can specify `--local` to print all locally installed plugins, as well as
whether you have "shadowed" plugins (the same plugin specified multiple times).
