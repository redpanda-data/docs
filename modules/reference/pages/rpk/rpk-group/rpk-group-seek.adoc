= rpk group seek

Modify a group's current offsets.

This command allows you to modify a group's offsets. Sometimes, you may need to
rewind a group if you had a mistaken deploy, or fast-forward a group if it is
falling behind on messages that can be skipped.

The `--to` option allows you to seek to the start of partitions, end of
partitions, or after a specific timestamp. The default is to seek any topic
previously committed. Using `--topics` allows to you set commits for only the
specified topics; all other commits will remain untouched. Topics with no
commits will not be committed unless allowed with `--allow-new-topics`.

The `--to-group` option allows you to seek to commits that are in another group.
This is a merging operation: if g1 is consuming topics A and B, and g2 is
consuming only topic B, `rpk group seek g1 --to-group g2` will update g1's
commits for topic B only. The `--topics` flag can be used to further narrow which
topics are updated. Unlike `--to`, all non-filtered topics are committed, even
topics not yet being consumed, meaning `--allow-new-topics` is not needed.

The `--to-file` option allows to seek to offsets specified in a text file with
the following format:

----
[TOPIC] [PARTITION] [OFFSET]
[TOPIC] [PARTITION] [OFFSET]
----

Each line contains the topic, the partition, and the offset to seek to. As with
the prior options, `--topics` allows filtering which topics are updated. Similar
to `--to-group`, all non-filtered topics are committed, even topics not yet being
consumed, meaning --allow-new-topics is not needed.

The `--to`, `--to-group`, and `--to-file` options are mutually exclusive. If you are
not authorized to describe or read some topics used in a group, you will not be
able to modify offsets for those topics.

== Examples

Seek group G to June 1st, 2021:

or

----
rpk group seek g --to 1622505600000
----

or

----
rpk group seek g --to 1622505600000000000
----

Seek group X to the commits of group Y topic foo:

----
rpk group seek X --to-group Y --topics foo
----

Seek group G's topics foo, bar, and biz to the end:

----
rpk group seek G --to end --topics foo,bar,biz
----

Seek group G to the beginning of a topic it was not previously consuming:

----
rpk group seek G --to start --topics foo --allow-new-topics
