= rpk group offset-delete

Forcefully delete offsets for a Kafka group.

The broker will only allow the request to succeed if the group is in a dead
state (no subscriptions) or there are no subscriptions for offsets for
topic/partitions requested to be deleted.

Use either the `--from-file` or the `--topic` option. They are mutually exclusive.
To indicate which topics or topic partitions you'd like to remove offsets from use
the `--topic` (`-t`) flag, followed by a comma separated list of partition IDs. Supplying
no list will delete all offsets for all partitions for a given topic.

You may also provide a text file to indicate topic/partition tuples. Use the
`--from-file` flag for this option. The file must contain lines of topic/partitions
separated by a tab or space. Example:

----
topic_a 0
topic_a 1
topic_b 0
----

== Usage

[,bash]
----
rpk group offset-delete [GROUP] --from-file FILE --topic foo:0,1,2 [flags]
----

== Flags
