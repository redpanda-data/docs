= rpk group delete

Delete consumer groups

Delete consumer groups explicitly through `rpk group delete`.

This allows you to proactively manage offsets, for example, when you've created temporary groups for quick investigation or testing and you want to clear offsets sooner than the automatic cleanup.

Consumer groups are automatically deleted when the last committed offset expires. Group offset deletion can happen through:

* Periodic Offset Expiration: Offsets expire automatically when the group has been empty for a set duration. See xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#group_offset_retention_sec[Cluster properties - `group_offset_retention_sec`]
* Kafka `OffsetDelete` API: Offsets can be explicitly deleted using the Kafka `OffsetDelete` API. See xref:reference:rpk/rpk-group/rpk-group-offset-delete.adoc[`rpk group offset delete`].
