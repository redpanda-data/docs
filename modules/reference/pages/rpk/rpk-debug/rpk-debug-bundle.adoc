= rpk debug bundle
:description: This command generates a diagnostics bundle for troubleshooting Redpanda deployments.

NOTE: In Kubernetes, you must run the `rpk debug bundle` command inside a container that's running a Redpanda broker.

== Concept

The `rpk debug bundle` command collects environment data that can help debug and diagnose issues with a Redpanda cluster, a broker, or the machine it's running on. It
then bundles the collected data into a ZIP file, called a diagnostics bundle.

=== Diagnostic bundle files

The files and directories in the diagnostics bundle differ depending on the
environment in which Redpanda is running:

=== Common files

* Kafka metadata: Broker configs, topic configs, start/committed/end offsets,
groups, group commits.
* Controller logs: The controller logs directory up to a limit set by
--controller-logs-size-limit flag
* Data directory structure: A file describing the data directory's contents.
* redpanda configuration: The redpanda configuration file (`redpanda.yaml`;
SASL credentials are stripped).
* /proc/cpuinfo: CPU information like make, core count, cache, frequency.
* /proc/interrupts: IRQ distribution across CPU cores.
* Resource usage data: CPU usage percentage, free memory available for the
redpanda process.
* Clock drift: The ntp clock delta (using pool.ntp.org as a reference) and round
trip time.
* Admin API calls: Cluster and broker configurations, cluster health data, and
license key information.
* Broker metrics: The broker's Prometheus metrics, fetched through its
admin API (/metrics and /public_metrics).

=== Bare-metal

* Kernel: The kernel logs ring buffer (syslog) and parameters (sysctl).
* DNS: The DNS info as reported by 'dig', using the hosts in
/etc/resolv.conf.
* Disk usage: The disk usage for the data directory, as output by 'du'.
* redpanda logs: The node's redpanda logs written to journald. If --logs-since
or --logs-until are passed, then only the logs within the resulting time frame
will be included.
* Socket info: The active sockets data output by 'ss'.
* Running process info: As reported by 'top'.
* Virtual memory stats: As reported by 'vmstat'.
* Network config: As reported by 'ip addr'.
* lspci: List the PCI buses and the devices connected to them.
* dmidecode: The DMI table contents. Only included if this command is run
as root.




=== Extra requests for partitions

You can provide a list of partitions to save additional admin API requests specifically for those partitions.

The partition flag accepts the format `<namespace>/[topic]/[partitions...]` where the namespace is optional, if the namespace is not provided, `rpk` will assume 'kafka'. For example:

Topic 'foo', partitions 1, 2 and 3:

[,bash]
----
--partitions foo/1,2,3
----

Namespace _redpanda-internal, topic 'bar', partition 2
[,bash]
----
--partitions _redpanda-internal/bar/2
----

If you have an upload URL from the Redpanda support team, provide it in the  --upload-url flag to upload your diagnostics bundle to Redpanda.

== Kubernetes

* Kubernetes Resources: Kubernetes manifests for all resources in the given
Kubernetes namespace (via --namespace).
* redpanda logs: Logs of each Pod in the the given Kubernetes namespace. If
--logs-since is passed, only the logs within the given timeframe are
included.

== Flags

|===
|*Value* |*Type* |*Description*

|--controller-logs-size-limit |string |Sets the limit of the controller
log size that can be stored in the bundle. Multipliers are also
supported, e.g. 3MB, 1GiB (default "20MB").

|-h, --help |- |Display documentation for `rpk debug bundle`.

|-l, --label-selector |stringArray |Comma-separated label selectors to filter your resources. e.g: <label>=<value>,<label>=<value> (k8s only) (default [app.kubernetes.io/name=redpanda]).

|--logs-since |string |Include log entries on or newer than the
specified date in journalctl date format, for example YYYY-MM-DD.

|--logs-size-limit |string |Read the logs until the given size is
reached. Multipliers are also supported, e.g. 3MB, 1GiB (default
"100MiB").

|--logs-until |string |Include log entries on or older than the
specified date in journalctl date format, for example YYYY-MM-DD. +
*Not supported in Kubernetes*

|--metrics-interval |duration |The amount of time to wait before
capturing the second snapshot of the metrics endpoints, for example
`30s` (30 seconds) or `1.5m` (90 seconds). This interval is useful
because some metrics are counters that need values at two points in
time. Default: `12s`. +
*Kubernetes only*

|--namespace |string |The Kubernetes namespace in which the Redpanda
cluster is running. Default: `redpanda` +
*Kubernetes only*.

|-o, --output |string |The file path where the debug file will be
written (default ./<timestamp>-bundle.zip).

|-p, --partition |stringArray |Comma-separated partition IDs; when provided, `rpk` saves extra admin API requests for those partitions. Check help for extended usage.

|--timeout |duration |The amount of time to wait for child commands to
execute, for example `30s` (30 seconds) or `1.5m` (90 seconds). Default:
`10s`.

|--upload-url |string |If provided, where to upload the bundle in
addition to creating a copy on disk.

|--config |string |Redpanda or `rpk` config file. Default search paths are: 
`~/.config/rpk/rpk.yaml`, `$PWD`, and `/etc/redpanda/redpanda.yaml`.

|-X, --config-opt |stringArray |Override `rpk` configuration settings. See xref:reference:rpk/rpk-x-options.adoc[`rpk -X`] or execute `rpk -X help` for inline detail or `rpk -X list` for terser detail.

|--profile |string |Profile to use. See xref:reference:rpk/rpk-profile.adoc[`rpk profile`] for more details.

|-v, --verbose |- |Enable verbose logging.
