= rpk redpanda admin config log-level set

Set broker logger's log level.

This command temporarily changes a broker logger's log level. Each Redpanda
broker has many loggers, and each can be individually changed. Any change
to a logger persists for a limited amount of time, so as to ensure you do
not accidentally enable debug logging permanently.

It is optional to specify a logger; if you do not, this command will prompt
from the set of available loggers.

The special logger `all` enables all loggers. Alternatively, you can specify
many loggers at once. To see all possible loggers, run the following command:

----
redpanda --help-loggers
----

This command accepts loggers that it does not know of to ensure you can
independently update your redpanda installations from rpk. The success or
failure of enabling each logger is individually printed.

== Usage

[,bash]
----
rpk redpanda admin config log-level set [LOGGERS...] [flags]
----
