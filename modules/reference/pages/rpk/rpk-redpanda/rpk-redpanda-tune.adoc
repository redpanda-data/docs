:description: rpk redpanda tune (autotuner)
:rpk_version: v23.2.1
:page-aliases: reference:autotune.adoc, introduction:autotune.adoc

`rpk redpanda tune`, also referred to as the autotuner, identifies the hardware configuration on your machine and optimizes the Linux kernel to give you the best performance for running Redpanda.

Available tuners:

* all
* disk_irq
* disk_scheduler
* disk_nomerges
* disk_write_cache
* fstrim
* net
* aio_events
* swappiness
* ballast_file
* cpu
* clocksource
* transparent_hugepages
* coredump

To learn more about a tuner, run `rpk redpanda tune help |tuner name|`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You should run the autotuner as part of the production deployment workflow. Redpanda recommends you first follow a guide for production deployment:

* xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/manual/production/production-deployment.adoc[Deploy for Production]
* xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/kubernetes/kubernetes-tune-workers.adoc[Tune Kubernetes Worker Nodes for Production]

While you follow the guides, consult this reference for details about the autotuner.
====

== Usage

[,bash]
----
rpk redpanda tune <list of elements to tune> [command] [flags]
----

[TIP]
====
* When running `rpk redpanda tune`, make sure that your current Linux user has root privileges. The autotuner requires privileged access to the Linux kernel settings.
* To run `rpk redpanda tune all` on a Redpanda broker automatically after broker or host restarts, configure the service `redpanda-tuner`, which runs `rpk redpanda tune all`, to run at boot-up:
** For RHEL, after installing the rpm package, run `systemctl` to both start and enable the `redpanda-tuner` service:
+
[,bash]
----
sudo systemctl start redpanda-tuner
sudo systemctl enable redpanda-tuner
----

** For Ubuntu, after installing the apt package, run `systemctl` to start the `redpanda-tuner` service (which is already enabled):
+
[,bash]
----
sudo systemctl start redpanda-tuner
----

== Flags

[cols="1m,1a,2a"]
|===
|*Value* |*Type* |*Description*

|--cpu-set |string |Set of CPUs for tuners to use in cpuset(7) format;
if not specified, tuners will use all available CPUs (default "all").

|-r, --dirs |strings |List of *data* directories or places to store data
(e.g. /var/vectorized/redpanda/); usually your XFS file system on an NVMe
SSD device.

|-d, --disks |strings |Lists of devices to tune f.e. 'sda1'.

|-h, --help |- |Help for tune.

|-m, --mode |string |Operation Mode: one of: [sq, sq_split, mq].

|-n, --nic |strings |Network Interface Controllers to tune.

|--output-script |string |Generate a tuning file that can later be used
to tune the system.

|--reboot-allowed |- |Allow tuners to tune boot parameters and request
system reboot.

|--timeout |duration |The maximum time to wait for the tune processes to
complete (e.g. 300ms, 1.5s, 2h45m) (default 10s).

|--config |string |Redpanda or rpk config file; default search paths are
~/.config/rpk/rpk.yaml, $PWD, and /etc/redpanda/redpanda.yaml.

|-X, --config-opt |stringArray |Override rpk configuration settings; '-X
help' for detail or '-X list' for terser detail.

|--profile |string |rpk profile to use.

|-v, --verbose |- |Enable verbose logging.

== Examples

This section provides examples of using the autotuner.

* To enable a predetermined set of tuners for production, run the xref:./rpk-redpanda-mode.adoc[rpk redpanda mode prod] command. This command modifies settings in the `redpanda.yaml` configuration file.
* To list the available tuners and to see whether they're enabled or supported (and a reason for if they're unsupported), run the xref:./rpk-redpanda-tune-list.adoc[rpk redpanda tune list] command.
* To enable or disable a tuner, run the xref:./rpk-redpanda-config-set.adoc[rpk redpanda config set], as the tuner flags are configurable node properties.
 ** Each tuner has a YAML key flag for enabling/disabling itself in `redpanda.yaml`. Most are formed by prepending `rpk.tune_` to the name of the tuner listed by xref:./rpk-redpanda-tune-list.adoc[rpk redpanda tune list]. See the xref:./rpk-redpanda-tune-list.adoc#tuners[Tuners reference] for the exact key for a tuner. For an example of enabling a tuner, the key for the `aio_events` tuner is `rpk.tune_aio_events`, and it can be enabled with the following command:
+
----
rpk redpanda config set rpk.tune_aio_events true
----
* To run all available tuners, use the xref:./rpk-redpanda-tune.adoc[rpk redpanda tune] command for `all`:
+
----
rpk redpanda tune all
----

* To run a specific tuner, use the xref:./rpk-redpanda-tune.adoc[rpk redpanda tune] command for the tuner:
+
----
rpk redpanda tune <tuner>
----

* To learn more about a tuner, use the xref:./rpk-redpanda-tune.adoc[rpk redpanda tune help] command for the tuner:
+
----
rpk redpanda tune help <tuner>
----
+
See also the xref:./rpk-redpanda-tune-list.adoc#tuners[Tuners reference] for descriptions about each tuner.
