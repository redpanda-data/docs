= rpk redpanda admin brokers list
:unsupported-os: macOS, Windows

include::reference:partial$unsupported-os-rpk.adoc[]

List the brokers in your cluster.

This command lists all brokers in the cluster, active and inactive, unless they have been decommissioned. Using the `--include-decommissioned` flag, it lists decommissioned brokers with associated UUIDs too.

The output table contains the following columns:

[.sortable] 
|===
| *Column* | *Description*

|ID |Node ID, an exclusive identifier for a broker.

|HOST |Internal RPC address for communication between brokers.

|PORT |Internal RPC port for communication between brokers.

|RACK |Assigned rack ID.

|CORES |Number of cores (shards) on a broker.

|MEMBERSHIP |Whether a broker is decommissioned or not.

|IS-ALIVE |Whether a broker is alive or offline.

|VERSION |Broker version.

|UUID |Additional exclusive identifier for a broker (Optional).
|===


NOTE: The UUID column is hidden when the cluster doesn't expose the UUID in the Admin API, or the API call fails to retrieve UUIDs.
