== Development mode

Development mode (`development` or `dev`) includes the following development-only settings:

* Sets `developer_mode` to `true`. This starts Redpanda with dev-mode only settings, including:
 ** No minimal memory limits are enforced.
 ** No core assignment rules for Redpanda nodes are enforced.
 ** Enables write caching, which is a relaxed mode of `acks=all` that acknowledges a message as soon as it is received and acknowledged on a majority of brokers, without waiting for it to fsync to disk. This provides lower latency while still ensuring that a majority of brokers acknowledge the write. For more information, or to disable this, see xref:develop:config-topics.adoc#configure-write-caching[write caching].
 ** Bypasses `fsync` (from https://docs.seastar.io/master/structseastar_1_1reactor%5F%5Foptions.html#ad66cb23f59ed5dfa8be8189313988692[Seastar option `unsafe_bypass_fsync`^]), which results in unrealistically fast clusters and may result in data loss.
* Sets `overprovisioned` to `true`. Redpanda expects a dev system to be an overprovisioned environment. Based on a https://docs.seastar.io/master/structseastar_1_1reactor%5F%5Foptions.html#a0caf6c2ad579b8c22e1352d796ec3c1d[Seastar option^], setting `overprovisioned` disables thread affinity, zeros idle polling time, and disables busy-poll for disk I/O.
* Sets all autotuner xref:./rpk-redpanda-tune-list.adoc#tuners[tuners] to `false`. The tuners are intended to run only for production mode.

== Production mode

Production mode (`production` or `prod`) disables dev-mode settings:

* `developer_mode: false`
* `overprovisioned: false`

It also enables a set of tuners of the autotuner. For descriptions about the tuners, see xref:./rpk-redpanda-tune-list.adoc#tuners[Tuners] in the xref:./rpk-redpanda-tune-list.adoc[rpk redpanda tune list] command reference.

== Recovery mode

Recovery mode (`recovery`) sets the broker configuration property `recovery_mode_enabled` to `true`. This provides a stable environment for troubleshooting and restoring a failed cluster.

== Usage

[,bash]
