= rpk redpanda tune list
:unsupported-os: macOS, Windows

include::reference:partial$unsupported-os-rpk.adoc[]

List available Redpanda tuners and check if they are enabled and
supported by your system.

To enable a tuner it must be set in the `redpanda.yaml` configuration file
under rpk section, for example:

[,yaml]
----
rpk:
tune_cpu: true
tune_swappiness: true
----

You may use `rpk redpanda config set` to enable or disable a tuner.

== Usage

== Tuners

This section describes each tuner and their configuration settings in xref:reference:node-configuration-sample.adoc[redpanda.yaml]. It provides overlapping and additional content to the descriptions returned by xref:reference:rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-tune.adoc[rpk redpanda tune help].

=== aio_events

The `aio_events` tuner maximizes throughput by increasing the number of simultaneous I/O requests. It sets the maximum number of outstanding asynchronous I/O operations to be above a calculated threshold.

Configuration (yaml):

* `rpk.tune_aio_events`: flag to enable the tuner (Default for production mode: true)

'''

=== ballast_file

The `ballast_file` tuner improves debuggability and recoverability of a system with a full disk by creating a ballast file: if the disk becomes full, the ballast file can be deleted, thereby unblocking processes that are failing due to write failures and providing time for operators to stop any problematic processes causing the disk to fill, and to delete topics or records and change retention settings.

Configuration (yaml):

* `rpk.tune_ballast_file`: flag to enable the tuner (Default for production mode: true)
* `rpk.ballast_file_size`: size of the ballast file in bytes (Default for production mode: 1 GiB)
* `rpk.ballast_file_path`: path to the ballast file (Default for production mode: `/var/lib/redpanda/data/ballast`)

'''

=== clocksource

The `clocksource` tuner improves the performance of getting system time by changing the clock source. It sets the clock source to the Time Stamp Counter (TSC) so time can be read in userspace via the Virtual Dynamic Shared Object (vDSO). This is more efficient than the usual virtual machine clock source, `xen`, that involves the overhead of a system call.

Configuration (yaml):

* `rpk.tune_clocksource`: flag to enable the tuner (Default for production mode: true)

'''

=== coredump

The `coredump` tuner enables coredumps to be saved for production mode. By default, coredumps are not enabled for production. Enabling this tuner sets the location to save coredumps.

Configuration (yaml):

* `rpk.tune_coredump`: flag to enable the tuner (Default for production mode: false)
* `rpk.coredump_dir`: path to the saved coredump (Default for production mode: `/var/lib/redpanda/coredump`)

'''

=== cpu

The `cpu` tuner maximizes CPU performance for I/O intensive workloads by optimizing various CPU settings. It performs the following operations:

* Sets the ACPI-cpufreq governor to `performance`

If system reboot is allowed (`rpk redpanda tune --reboot-allowed` option is set), the system must be rebooted after the first pass of the tuner, and it performs additional operations:

* Disables Intel P-states
* Disables Intel C-states
* Disables turbo boost

After tuning, the system CPUs operate at the maximum non-turbo frequency.

Configuration (yaml):

* `rpk.tune_cpu`: flag to enable the tuner (Default for production mode: true)

'''

=== disk_irq

The `disk_irq` tuner optimizes the handling of interrupt requests (IRQs) for disks binding all disk IRQs to a requested set of CPUs. It tries to distribute IRQs according to the following guidelines:

* Distribute NVMe disks IRQs equally among all available CPUs.
* Distribute non-NVMe disks IRQs equally among designated CPUs or among all available CPUs in the `mq` mode.

IRQs are distributed according to the operation mode set by `rpk redpanda tune --mode <operation-mode>`. The available operation modes:

* `sq`: set all IRQs of a given device to CPU0
* `sq_split`: divide all IRQs of a given device between CPU0 and its HT siblings
* `mq`: distribute device IRQs among all available CPUs instead of binding them all to CPU0

If no `--mode` is specified, a default mode is determined:

* If there are only NVMe disks, the `mq` mode is set as the default.
* For non-NVMe disks:
** If the number of HT siblings is less than or equal to four, the `mq` mode is set as the default.
** Otherwise, if the number of cores is less than or equal to four, the `sq` mode is set as the default.
** For all other conditions, the `sq_split` mode is set as the default.

Configuration (yaml):

* `rpk.tune_disk_irq`: flag to enable the tuner (Default for production mode: true)
* `rpk redpanda tune --mode <operation-mode>` sets the IRQ distribution mode

'''

=== net

The `net` tuner optimizes the handling of interrupt requests (IRQs) for network interfaces (NICs) by binding all NIC IRQs to a requested set of CPUs.

Its IRQ distribution operation modes are the same as described for the <<disk_irq,disk_irq tuner>> with NICs as the devices.

Configuration (yaml):

* `rpk.tune_network`: flag to enable the tuner (Default for production mode: true)
* `rpk redpanda tune --mode <operation-mode>` sets the IRQ distribution mode

'''

=== disk_nomerges

The `disk_nomerges` tuner reduces CPU overhead by disabling the merging of adjacent I/O requests.

Configuration (yaml):

* `rpk.tune_disk_nomerges`: flag to enable the tuner (Default for production mode: true)

'''

=== disk_scheduler

The `disk_scheduler` tuner optimizes disk scheduler performance for the type of device (NVME, non-NVME). It provides a selectable set of schedulers:

* `none`: minimizes latency of modern NVMe devices by bypassing the operating system's I/O scheduler
* `noop`: preferred for non-NVME devices (and used when `none` is unavailable), this scheduler uses a simple FIFO queue where all I/O operations are first stored and then handled by the driver.

Configuration (yaml):

* `rpk.tune_disk_scheduler`: flag to enable the tuner (Default for production mode: true)

'''

=== disk_write_cache

The `disk_write_cache` tuner optimizes performance in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by enabling write-through caching for its NVMe `Local SSD` drives.

Configuration (yaml):

* `rpk.tune_disk_write_cache`: flag to enable the tuner (Default for production mode: true)

'''

=== fstrim

The `fstrim` tuner improves SSD performance by starting a background systemd service to periodically wipe memory blocks that are not used by the file system. This is desirable for SSDs because they require wiping the space where new data will be written, so not wiping during non-write cycles will eventually cause performance degradations, when the lack of free space results in writes triggering synchronous erasures.

If it's available, the `fstrim` systemd service will be run. If it's unavailable but systemd is available, an equivalent service will be installed and run. Otherwise, no service will be run.

Configuration (yaml):

* `rpk.tune_fstrim`: flag to enable the tuner (Default for production mode: true)

'''

=== swappiness

The `swappiness` tuner tunes the kernel to keep process data in-memory for as long as possible instead of swapping it out to disk.

Configuration (yaml):

* `rpk.tune_swappiness`: flag to enable the tuner (Default for production mode: true)

'''

=== transparent_hugepages

Redpanda makes excellent use of OS-level Transparent HugePages (THP) through pre-allocating memory at startup. For CPUs that support THPs, this results in improved memory page caching and reduced cache misses from Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) lookups.

Most operating systems configure THP use to `madvise` by default, meaning a process must explicitly request them. Redpanda is designed to make the required `madvise` call, meaning THPs are in use under typical operation scenarios. Other possible values for THP use are `disabled` or `always`.

The `transparent_hugepages` tuner overrides the OS setting, configuring THP use to `always`. This tuner only has a practical effect if the OS is configured to `disabled` for THP use. For this reason, this tuner is disabled by default in production mode. It primarily exists to allow operators to ensure THPs are in use for their installations if there is any possibility the OS is configured to `disabled`.

Configuration (yaml):

* `rpk.tune_transparent_hugepages`: flag to enable the tuner (Default for production mode: false)
