= Docker Compose Samples for Redpanda
:description: Docker Compose Samples for Redpanda and Redpanda Console.
:page-aliases: console:reference/docker-compose.adoc, reference:console/docker-compose.adoc

Use these Docker Compose samples to test Redpanda features and applications during development.

.Redpanda in Docker is supported only for development and testing.
[NOTE]
====
To deploy Redpanda in production, use one of the following environments:

* xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/manual/index.adoc[Linux]
* xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/kubernetes/index.adoc[Kubernetes]
====

== Prerequisites

To run `docker compose` you must install Docker on your machine. See the
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker documentation^].

== Owl shop sample application

This `docker-compose.yml` file starts a single Redpanda broker, Redpanda Console, and a sample application called _owl shop_. Owl shop simulates a simple ecommerce shop that uses Redpanda as an asynchronous communication exchange. Owl shop creates topics, produces sample data to those topics, and consumes from those topics.

. Paste the following YAML into a `docker-compose.yml` file on your computer, and run `docker compose up -d` inside the same directory.
+
NOTE: If you are running on an ARM-based device such as the Apple M1 chip, uncomment the `platform: 'linux/amd64'` lines.

. Open Redpanda Console at http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080^] and go to *Topics* to see the Owl Shop topics.

== Samples for Redpanda Enterprise Edition

This section contains `docker-compose.yml` files with features that require a license key for Redpanda Enterprise Edition. The license key is uploaded to the Redpanda broker through a separate container called `redpandarpk`. This container executes the `rpk cluster license set` command to load the license key from the given filepath.

To request a trial license, to extend your trial period, or to purchase an Enterprise Edition license, + 
contact https://redpanda.com/try-redpanda?section=enterprise-trial[Redpanda Sales^].

In the same location as your `docker-compose.yml` file, save your license key to a file called `redpanda.license` in a directory called `license`. Or, to use another location, update the license paths in the `docker-compose.yml` files to another directory that contains your license key.

=== Plain login authentication for Redpanda Console

This `docker-compose.yml` file configures Redpanda Console with a plain login provider so that users of Redpanda Console must log in with a username and password.

. Paste the following YAML into a `docker-compose.yml` file on your computer, and run `docker compose up -d` inside the same directory.

== Customize the samples

If you want to configure Redpanda or Redpanda Console, you need to customize the sample YAML files.

=== Configure Redpanda in Docker

To configure the Redpanda services with xref:./node-properties.adoc[node configuration properties], you can do the following:

- Pass configuration properties to the `--set` option in the `redpanda start` command. For example:
+
[,yaml]
----
redpanda:
  command:
    - redpanda
    - start
    - --set pandaproxy_client.retries=6
----

- Create a `redpanda.yaml` file and mount it to the `/etc/redpanda/` directory on the `redpanda` containers. For example, if you create the `redpanda.yaml` file in a directory called `redpanda-mounts`, configure the following volume mounts:
+
[,yaml]
----
redpanda:
  volumes:
    - ./redpanda-mounts:/etc/redpanda/
----

=== Configure Redpanda Console in Docker

To configure the Redpanda Console service with xref:reference:console/config.adoc[configuration properties], you can do the following:

* Use environment variables, for example:
+
[,yaml]
----
console:
  environment:
    KAFKA_RACKID: rack1
----

* Create a `redpanda-console-config.yaml` file and mount it to the `/etc/redpanda/` directory on the `redpanda-console` container. For example, if you create the `redpanda-console-config.yaml` file in a directory called `console-mounts`, configure the following volume mounts:
+
[,yaml]
----
console:
  volumes:
    - ./console-mounts:/etc/redpanda/
----
