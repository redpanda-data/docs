= Broker Configuration Template
:description: Redpanda broker configuration YAML template with properties description.

== Sample configuration

The following `redpanda.yaml` configuration file includes a complete list of all broker properties and their descriptions.
For a summary of all available broker properties, see xref:./node-properties.adoc[Broker Configuration Properties].

[CAUTION]
====
This is not a valid Redpanda configuration file, but it shows the properties you can configure in the `redpanda.yaml` file. Ensure that all values entered are properly enclosed in quotes and escaped as necessary. For example, put passwords with special characters in single quotes.
