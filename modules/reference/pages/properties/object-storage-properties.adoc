= Object Storage Properties
:description: Reference of object storage properties.
:page-aliases: reference:object-storage-properties.adoc

Object storage properties are a type of cluster property. Cluster properties are configuration settings that control the behavior of a Redpanda cluster at a global level. Configuring cluster properties allows you to adapt Redpanda to specific workloads, optimize resource usage, and enable or disable features. 

For information on how to edit cluster properties, see xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/cluster-property-configuration.adoc[]. 

NOTE: Some object storage properties require that you restart the cluster for any updates to take effect. See the specific property details to identify whether or not a restart is required.

== Cluster configuration

Object storage properties should only be set if you enable xref:manage:tiered-storage.adoc[Tiered Storage]. 

=== cloud_storage_access_key

AWS or GCP access key. This access key is part of the credentials that Redpanda requires to authenticate with object storage services for Tiered Storage. This access key is used with the <<cloud_storage_secret_key,`cloud_storage_secret_key`>> to form the complete credentials required for authentication.

To authenticate using IAM roles, see <<cloud_storage_credentials_source,`cloud_storage_credentials_source`>>.

*Requires restart:* Yes

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* string

*Default:* `null`

---

=== cloud_storage_api_endpoint

Optional API endpoint. The only instance in which you must set this value is when using a custom domain with your object storage service.

- AWS: If not set, this is automatically generated using <<cloud_storage_region,region>> and <<cloud_storage_bucket,bucket>>. Otherwise, this uses the value assigned.
- GCP: If not set, this is automatically generated using `storage.googleapis.com` and <<cloud_storage_bucket,bucket>>.
- Azure: If not set, this is automatically generated using `blob.core.windows.net` and <<cloud_storage_azure_storage_account,`cloud_storage_azure_storage_account`>>. If you have enabled hierarchical namespaces for your storage account and use a custom endpoint, use <<cloud_storage_azure_adls_endpoint,`cloud_storage_azure_adls_endpoint`>>.

*Requires restart:* No

*Gets restored during cluster restore:* No

*Optional:* Yes (if not using a custom domain)

*Visibility:* `user`

=== cloud_storage_hydrated_chunks_per_segment_ratio

The maximum number of chunks per segment that can be hydrated at a time. Above this number, unused chunks are trimmed.

A segment is divided into chunks. Chunk hydration means downloading the chunk (which is a small part of a full segment) from cloud storage and placing it in the local disk cache. Redpanda periodically removes old, unused chunks from your local disk. This process is called chunk eviction. This property  controls how many chunks can be present for a given segment in local disk at a time, before eviction is triggered, removing the oldest ones from disk. Note that this property is not used for the default eviction strategy which simply removes all unused chunks.

*Requires restart:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* number

*Accepted values:* [`0`, `1`]

*Default:* `0.7`

---

=== cloud_storage_hydration_timeout_ms

Time to wait for a hydration request to be fulfilled. If hydration is not completed within this time, the consumer is notified with a timeout error.

Negative doesn't make sense, but it may not be checked-for/enforced. Large is subjective, but a huge timeout also doesn't make sense. This particular config doesn't have a min/max bounds control, but it probably should to avoid mistakes.

*Unit:* milliseconds

*Requires restart:* No

=== cloud_storage_max_concurrent_hydrations_per_shard

Maximum concurrent segment hydrations of remote data per CPU core.  If unset, value of `cloud_storage_max_connections / 2` is used, which means that half of available object storage bandwidth could be used to download data from object storage. If the cloud storage cache is empty every new segment reader will require a download. This will lead to 1:1 mapping between number of partitions scanned by the fetch request and number of parallel downloads. If this value is too large the downloads can affect other workloads. In case of any problem caused by the tiered-storage reads this value can be lowered. This will only affect segment hydrations (downloads) but won't affect cached segments. If fetch request is reading from the tiered-storage cache its concurrency will only be limited by available memory.

=== cloud_storage_recovery_topic_validation_mode

Validation performed before recovering a topic from object storage. In case of failure, the reason for the failure appears as `ERROR` lines in the Redpanda application log. For each topic, this reports errors for all partitions, but for each partition, only the first error is reported.

This property accepts the following parameters:

- `no_check`: Skips the checks for topic recovery.
- `check_manifest_existence`:  Runs an existence check on each `partition_manifest`. Fails if there are connection issues to the object storage.
- `check_manifest_and_segment_metadata`: Downloads the manifest and runs a consistency check, comparing the metadata with the cloud storage objects. The process fails if metadata references any missing cloud storage objects.

Example: Redpanda validates the topic `kafka/panda-topic-recovery-NOT-OK` and stops due to a fatal error on partition 0:

```bash
ERROR 2024-04-24 21:29:08,166 [shard 1:main] cluster - [fiber11|0|299996ms recovery validation of {kafka/panda-topic-recovery-NOT-OK/0}/24] - manifest metadata check: missing segment, validation not ok
ERROR 2024-04-24 21:29:08,166 [shard 1:main] cluster - topics_frontend.cc:519 - Stopping recovery of {kafka/panda-topic-recovery-NOT-OK} due to validation error
```

Each failing partition error message has the following format:

```bash
ERROR .... [... recovery validation of {<namespace/topic/partition>}...] - <failure-reason>, validation not ok
```

At the end of the process, Redpanda outputs a final ERROR message: 

```bash
ERROR ... ... - Stopping recovery of {<namespace/topic>} due to validation error
```

=== cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_max_segments

Maximum number of segments in the spillover manifest that can be offloaded to the object storage. This setting serves as a threshold for triggering data offload based on the number of segments, rather than the total size of the manifest. It is designed for use in testing environments to control the offload behavior more granularly. In production settings, manage offloads based on the manifest size through `cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_size` for more predictable outcomes.

*Requires restart:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `null`

---

=== cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_size

The size of the manifest which can be offloaded to the cloud. If the size of the local manifest stored in Redpanda exceeds `cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_size` by two times the spillover mechanism will split the manifest into two parts and one will be uploaded to object storage.

*Requires restart:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `65536`

---

=== cloud_storage_throughput_limit_percent

Maximum throughput used by Tiered Storage per broker expressed as a percentage of the disk bandwidth. If the server has several disks, Redpanda uses the one that stores the Tiered Storage cache. Even if Tiered Storage is allowed to use the full bandwidth of the disk (100%), it won't necessarily use it in full. The actual usage depends on your workload and the state of the Tiered Storage cache. This setting is a safeguard that prevents Tiered Storage from using too many system resources: it is not a performance tuning knob.

*Unit:* percent

*Requires restart:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `50`

---

=== cloud_storage_url_style

Configure the addressing style for Amazon S3 requests. This property controls how Redpanda formats S3 bucket URLs when communicating with object storage.

Leave this property unset (`null`) to use automatic configuration:

* For AWS S3: Redpanda attempts `virtual_host` addressing first, then falls back to `path` style if needed
* For MinIO: Redpanda automatically uses `path` style regardless of `MINIO_DOMAIN` configuration

Set this property explicitly when:

* You use S3-compatible storage that requires a specific URL format
* You want to override the default MinIO behavior (for example, to use `virtual_host` with a properly configured `MINIO_DOMAIN`)
* You want consistent behavior across deployments

NOTE: For MinIO deployments, Redpanda defaults to `path` style when this property is unset. If you have configured `MINIO_DOMAIN` and want to use `virtual_host` addressing, set this property explicitly to `virtual_host`. For other S3-compatible storage backends, consult your provider's documentation to determine the required URL style. 

*Requires restart:* Yes

*Visibility:* `user`

*Accepted values:* 

* `virtual_host` - Example: `<bucket-name>.s3.amazonaws.com` 
* `path` - Example: `s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket-name>`
* `null` - Enable automatic configuration

*Default:* `null`
