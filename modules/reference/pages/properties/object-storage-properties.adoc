= Object Storage Properties 
:description: Reference of object storage properties. 

Object storage properties are a type of cluster property. For information on how to edit cluster properties, see xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/cluster-property-configuration.adoc[]. 

NOTE: Some object storage properties require that you restart the cluster for any updates to take effect. See the specific property details to identify whether or not a restart is required.

== Cloud configuration

Object storage properties should only be set if you enable xref:manage:tiered-storage.adoc[Tiered Storage]. 

=== cloud_storage_access_key

AWS or GCP access key. This access key is part of the credentials that Redpanda requires to authenticate with object storage services for Tiered Storage. This access key is used with the <<cloud_storage_secret_key>> to form the complete credentials required for authentication.

To authenticate using IAM roles, see <<cloud_storage_credentials_source>>.

=== cloud_storage_recovery_topic_validation_mode

Validation performed before recovering a topic from object storage. In case of failure, the reason for the failure appears as `ERROR` lines in the Redpanda application log. For each topic, this reports errors for all partitions, but for each partition, only the first error is reported.

This property accepts the following parameters:

- `no_check`: Skips the checks for topic recovery.
- `check_manifest_existence`:  Runs an existence check on each `partition_manifest`. Fails if there are connection issues to the object storage.
- `check_manifest_and_segment_metadata`: Downloads the manifest and runs a consistency check, comparing the metadata with the cloud storage objects. The process fails if metadata references any missing cloud storage objects.

Example: Redpanda validates the topic `kafka/panda-topic-recovery-NOT-OK` and stops due to a fatal error on partition 0:

```bash
ERROR 2024-04-24 21:29:08,166 [shard 1:main] cluster - [fiber11|0|299996ms recovery validation of {kafka/panda-topic-recovery-NOT-OK/0}/24] - manifest metadata check: missing segment, validation not ok
ERROR 2024-04-24 21:29:08,166 [shard 1:main] cluster - topics_frontend.cc:519 - Stopping recovery of {kafka/panda-topic-recovery-NOT-OK} due to validation error
```

Each failing partition error message has the following format:

```bash
ERROR .... [... recovery validation of {<namespace/topic/partition>}...] - <failure-reason>, validation not ok
```

At the end of the process, Redpanda outputs a final ERROR message: 

```bash
ERROR ... ... - Stopping recovery of {<namespace/topic>} due to validation error
```

*Requires restart:* No

*Optional:* No

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* number

*Default:* `20.0`

---

=== cloud_storage_cache_trim_carryover_bytes

The cache performs a recursive directory inspection during the cache trim. The information obtained during the inspection can be carried over to the next trim operation.

Adjusting this property allows for tuning the balance between improved read performance and increased network and storage I/O.

*Requires restart:* No

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Accepted values:* [`0`, `65535`]

*Default:* `0`

---

Number of groups to upload in a single snapshot object during consumer offsets upload. Setting a lower value means a larger number of smaller snapshots are uploaded.

*Requires restart:* No

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `1000`

---

=== cloud_storage_cluster_metadata_retries

*Requires restart:* No

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* boolean

*Default:* `true`

---

=== cloud_storage_enable_remote_read

Default remote read config value for new topics.

---

=== cloud_storage_hydrated_chunks_per_segment_ratio

The maximum number of chunks per segment that can be hydrated at a time. Above this number, unused chunks are trimmed.

A segment is divided into chunks. Chunk hydration means downloading the chunk (which is a small part of a full segment) from cloud storage and placing it in the local disk cache. Redpanda periodically removes old, unused chunks from your local disk. This process is called chunk eviction. This property  controls how many chunks can be present for a given segment in local disk at a time, before eviction is triggered, removing the oldest ones from disk. Note that this property is not used for the default eviction strategy which simply removes all unused chunks.

*Requires restart:* No

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* number

*Accepted values:* [`0`, `1`]

*Default:* `0.7`

---

=== cloud_storage_hydration_timeout_ms

Time to wait for a hydration request to be fulfilled. If hydration is not completed within this time, the consumer is notified with a timeout error.

Negative doesn't make sense, but it may not be checked-for/enforced. Large is subjective, but a huge timeout also doesn't make sense. This particular config doesn't have a min/max bounds control, but it probably should to avoid mistakes.

*Unit:* milliseconds

*Requires restart:* No

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Accepted values:* [`0`, `17592186044415`]

*Default:* `600000`

The object storage request rate threshold for idle state detection. If the average request rate for the configured period is lower than this threshold, the object storage is considered idle.

*Requires restart:* No

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* number

*Default:* `10.0`

---

=== cloud_storage_idle_timeout_ms

The timeout, in milliseconds, used to detect the idle state of the object storage API. If the average object storage request rate is below this threshold for a configured amount of time, the object storage is considered idle and the housekeeping jobs are started.

*Unit:* milliseconds

*Requires restart:* No

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Accepted values:* [`-17592186044416`, `17592186044415`]

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `1048576`

---

=== cloud_storage_manifest_cache_ttl_ms

The interval, in milliseconds, determines how long the materialized manifest can stay in the cache under contention. This setting is used for performance tuning. When the spillover manifest is materialized and stored in the cache, and the cache needs to evict it, it uses this value as a timeout. The cursor that uses the spillover manifest uses this value as a TTL interval, after which it stops referencing the manifest making it available for eviction. This only affects spillover manifests under contention.

*Unit:* milliseconds

*Requires restart:* No

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Accepted values:* [`-17592186044416`, `17592186044415`]

*Default:* `10000`

---

=== cloud_storage_manifest_max_upload_interval_sec

Minimum interval, in seconds, between partition manifest uploads. Actual time between uploads may be greater than this interval. If this is `null`, metadata is updated after each segment upload.

*Requires restart:* No

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Accepted values:* [`-17592186044416`, `17592186044415`]

*Default:* `10000`

---

=== cloud_storage_max_concurrent_hydrations_per_shard

Maximum concurrent segment hydrations of remote data per CPU core.  If unset, value of `cloud_storage_max_connections / 2` is used, which means that half of available object storage bandwidth could be used to download data from object storage. If the cloud storage cache is empty every new segment reader will require a download. This will lead to 1:1 mapping between number of partitions scanned by the fetch request and number of parallel downloads. If this value is too large the downloads can affect other workloads. In case of any problem caused by the tiered-storage reads this value can be lowered. This will only affect segment hydrations (downloads) but won't affect cached segments. If fetch request is reading from the tiered-storage cache its concurrency will only be limited by available memory.


*Requires restart:* No

*Optional:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Accepted values:* [`0`, `4294967295`]

*Default:* `null`

---

=== cloud_storage_max_connection_idle_time_ms

---

=== cloud_storage_max_segment_readers_per_shard

Maximum concurrent I/O cursors of materialized remote segments per CPU core.  If unset, the value of `topic_partitions_per_shard` is used, where one segment reader per partition is used if the shard is at its maximum partition capacity.  These readers are cached across Kafka consume requests and store a readahead buffer.

*Requires restart:* No

*Optional:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Accepted values:* [`0`, `4294967295`]

*Default:* `null`

---

=== cloud_storage_max_segments_pending_deletion_per_partition

=== cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_max_segments

Maximum number of segments in the spillover manifest that can be offloaded to the object storage. This setting serves as a threshold for triggering data offload based on the number of segments, rather than the total size of the manifest. It is designed for use in testing environments to control the offload behavior more granularly. In production settings, manage offloads based on the manifest size through `cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_size` for more predictable outcomes.

*Requires restart:* No

*Optional:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `null`

---

=== cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_size

The size of the manifest which can be offloaded to the cloud. If the size of the local manifest stored in Redpanda exceeds `cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_size` by two times the spillover mechanism will split the manifest into two parts and one will be uploaded to object storage.

*Requires restart:* No

*Optional:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `65536`

---

=== cloud_storage_throughput_limit_percent

Maximum throughput used by Tiered Storage per broker expressed as a percentage of the disk bandwidth. If the server has several disks, Redpanda uses the one that stores the Tiered Storage cache. Even if Tiered Storage is allowed to use the full bandwidth of the disk (100%), it won't necessarily use it in full. The actual usage depends on your workload and the state of the Tiered Storage cache. This setting is a safeguard that prevents Tiered Storage from using too many system resources: it is not a performance tuning knob.
