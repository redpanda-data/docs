= Broker Configuration Properties 
:page-aliases: reference:node-properties.adoc, reference:node-configuration-sample.adoc, reference:broker-properties.adoc
:description: Reference of broker configuration properties. 

Broker configuration properties are applied individually to each broker in a cluster. You can find and modify these properties in the `redpanda.yaml` configuration file.

For information on how to edit broker properties, see xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/node-property-configuration.adoc[].

NOTE: All broker properties require that you restart Redpanda for any update to take effect.

== Broker configuration

=== admin

Network address for the glossterm:Admin API[] server.

*Visibility:* `user`

*Default:* `127.0.0.1:9644`

---

=== admin_api_doc_dir

Path to the API specifications for the Admin API.

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* string

*Default:* `/usr/share/redpanda/admin-api-doc`

---

=== admin_api_tls

Specifies the TLS configuration for the HTTP Admin API.

*Visibility:* `user`

*Default:* `null`

---

=== crash_loop_limit

A limit on the number of consecutive times a broker can crash within one hour before its crash-tracking logic is reset. This limit prevents a broker from getting stuck in an infinite cycle of crashes.

If `null`, the property is disabled and no limit is applied.

The crash-tracking logic is reset (to zero consecutive crashes) by any of the following conditions:

* The broker shuts down cleanly.
* One hour passes since the last crash.
* The `redpanda.yaml` broker configuration file is updated.
* The `startup_log` file in the broker's <<data_directory, data_directory>> is manually deleted.

*Unit*: number of consecutive crashes of a broker

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* integer

*Accepted values:* [`0`, `4294967295`]

*Default:* `5`

---

=== crash_loop_sleep_sec

*Introduced in v24.3.4*

The amount of time the broker sleeps before terminating when the limit on consecutive broker crashes (<<crash_loop_limit, `crash_loop_limit`>>) is reached. This property provides a debugging window for you to access the broker before it terminates, and is particularly useful in Kubernetes environments.

If `null`, the property is disabled, and the broker terminates immediately after reaching the crash loop limit.

For information about how to reset the crash loop limit, see `crash_loop_limit`.

*Unit:* seconds

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* integer or null

*Accepted values:* [`0`, `4294967295`] or `null`

*Default:* `null`

---

=== data_directory

Path to the directory for storing Redpanda's streaming data files.

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* string

*Default:* `null`

---

=== developer_mode

CAUTION: Enabling `developer_mode` isn't recommended for production use.

Enable developer mode, which skips most of the checks performed at startup.

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* boolean

*Default:* `false`

---

=== emergency_disable_data_transforms

Override the cluster property xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#data_transforms_enabled[`data_transforms_enabled`] and disable Wasm-powered data transforms. This is an emergency shutoff button.

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* boolean

*Default:* `false`

---

=== empty_seed_starts_cluster

Controls how a new cluster is formed. All brokers in a cluster must have the same value.

<<seed_servers,See how the `empty_seed_starts_cluster` setting works with the `seed_servers` setting>> to form a cluster.

TIP: For backward compatibility, `true` is the default. Redpanda recommends using `false` in production environments to prevent accidental cluster formation.

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* boolean

*Default:* `true`

---

=== fips_mode

Controls whether Redpanda starts in FIPS mode.  This property allows for three values: 

* Disabled - Redpanda does not start in FIPS mode.

* Permissive - Redpanda performs the same check as enabled, but a warning is logged, and Redpanda continues to run. Redpanda loads the OpenSSL FIPS provider into the OpenSSL library. After this completes, Redpanda is operating in FIPS mode, which means that the TLS cipher suites available to users are limited to the TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 NIST-approved cryptographic methods.

* Enabled - Redpanda verifies that the operating system is enabled for FIPS by checking `/proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled`. If the file does not exist or does not return `1`, Redpanda immediately exits.

*Visibility:* `user`

*Accepted values:* `0` (disabled), `1` (permissive), `2` (enabled)

*Default:* `0` (disabled)

---

=== kafka_api

IP address and port of the Kafka API endpoint that handles requests.

*Visibility:* `user`

*Default:* `127.0.0.1:9092`

---

=== kafka_api_tls

Transport Layer Security (TLS) configuration for the Kafka API endpoint.

*Visibility:* `user`

*Default:* `null`

---

=== memory_allocation_warning_threshold

Threshold for log messages that contain a larger memory allocation than specified.

*Unit:* bytes
*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `131073` (128_kib + 1)

---

=== node_id

A number that uniquely identifies the broker within the cluster. If `null` (the default value), Redpanda automatically assigns an ID. If set, it must be non-negative value.

.Do not set `node_id` manually.
[WARNING]
====
Redpanda assigns unique IDs automatically to prevent issues such as:

- Brokers with empty disks rejoining the cluster.
- Conflicts during recovery or scaling.

Manually setting or reusing `node_id` values, even for decommissioned brokers, can cause cluster inconsistencies and operational failures.
====

Broker IDs are immutable. After a broker joins the cluster, its `node_id` *cannot* be changed.

*Accepted values:* [`0`, `4294967295`]

*Type:* integer

*Visibility:* `user`

*Default:* `null`

---

=== openssl_config_file

Path to the configuration file used by OpenSSL to properly load the FIPS-compliant module.

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* string

*Default:* `null`

---

=== openssl_module_directory

Path to the directory that contains the OpenSSL FIPS-compliant module. The filename that Redpanda looks for is `fips.so`.

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* string

*Default:* `null`

---

=== rack

A label that identifies a failure zone. Apply the same label to all brokers in the same failure zone. When xref:./cluster-properties.adoc#enable_rack_awareness[enable_rack_awareness] is set to `true` at the cluster level, the system uses the rack labels to spread partition replicas across different failure zones.

*Visibility:* `user`

*Default:* `null`

---

=== recovery_mode_enabled

If `true`, start Redpanda in xref:manage:recovery-mode.adoc[recovery mode], where user partitions are not loaded and only administrative operations are allowed.

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* boolean

*Default:* `false`

---

=== rpc_server

IP address and port for the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) server.

*Visibility:* `user`

*Default:* `127.0.0.1:33145`

---

=== rpc_server_tls

TLS configuration for the RPC server.

*Visibility:* `user`

---

=== seed_servers

List of the seed servers used to join current cluster. If the `seed_servers` list is empty the node will be a cluster root and it will form a new cluster.

* When `empty_seed_starts_cluster` is `true`, Redpanda enables one broker with an empty `seed_servers` list to initiate a new cluster. The broker with an empty `seed_servers` becomes the cluster root, to which other brokers must connect to join the cluster.  Brokers looking to join the cluster should have their `seed_servers` populated with the cluster root's address, facilitating their connection to the cluster.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Only one broker, the designated cluster root, should have an empty `seed_servers` list during the initial cluster bootstrapping. This ensures a single initiation point for cluster formation.
====

* When `empty_seed_starts_cluster` is `false`, Redpanda requires all brokers to start with a known set of brokers listed in `seed_servers`. The `seed_servers` list must not be empty and should be identical across these initial seed brokers, containing the addresses of all seed brokers. Brokers not included in the `seed_servers` list use it to discover and join the cluster, allowing for expansion beyond the foundational members.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `seed_servers` list must be consistent across all seed brokers to prevent cluster fragmentation and ensure stable cluster formation.
====
