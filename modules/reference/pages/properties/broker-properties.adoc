= Broker Configuration Properties 
:page-aliases: reference:node-properties.adoc, reference:node-configuration-sample.adoc
:description: Reference of broker configuration properties. 

Broker configuration properties are applied individually to each broker in a cluster. You can find and modify these properties in the `redpanda.yaml` configuration file.

For information on how to edit broker properties, see xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/node-property-configuration.adoc[].

NOTE: All broker properties require that you restart Redpanda for any update to take effect.

== Broker configuration

=== admin

Network address for the glossterm:Admin API[] server.

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `user`

*Default:* `127.0.0.1:9644`

---

=== admin_api_doc_dir

Path to the API specifications for the Admin API.

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* string

*Default:* `/usr/share/redpanda/admin-api-doc`

---

=== admin_api_tls

Specifies the TLS configuration for the HTTP Admin API.

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `user`

*Default:* `null`

---

=== crash_loop_limit

A limit on the number of consecutive times a broker can crash within one hour before its crash-tracking logic is reset. This limit prevents a broker from getting stuck in an infinite cycle of crashes.

If `null`, the property is disabled and no limit is applied.

The crash-tracking logic is reset (to zero consecutive crashes) by any of the following conditions:

* The broker shuts down cleanly.
* One hour passes since the last crash.
* The `redpanda.yaml` broker configuration file is updated.
* The `startup_log` file in the broker's <<data_directory,data_directory>> is manually deleted.

*Units*: number of consecutive crashes of a broker

*Optional:* No

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* integer

*Accepted values:* [`0`, `4294967295`]

*Default:* `5`

---

=== data_directory

Path to the directory for storing Redpanda's streaming data files.

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* string

*Default:* `null`

---

=== developer_mode

CAUTION: Enabling `developer_mode` isn't recommended for production use.

Flag to enable developer mode, which skips most of the checks performed at startup.

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* boolean

*Default:* `false`

---

=== emergency_disable_data_transforms

Override the cluster property xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#data_transforms_enabled[`data_transforms_enabled`] and disable Wasm-powered data transforms. This is an emergency shutoff button.

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* boolean

*Default:* `false`

---

=== empty_seed_starts_cluster

Controls how a new cluster is formed. All brokers in a cluster must have the same value.

<<seed_servers,See how the `empty_seed_starts_cluster` setting works with the `seed_servers` setting>> to form a cluster.

TIP: For backward compatibility, `true` is the default. Redpanda recommends using `false` in production environments to prevent accidental cluster formation.

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* boolean

*Default:* `true`

---

=== kafka_api

IP address and port of the Kafka API endpoint that handles requests.

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `user`

*Default:* `127.0.0.1:9092`

---

=== kafka_api_tls

Transport Layer Security (TLS) configuration for the Kafka API endpoint.

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `user`

*Default:* `null`

---

=== memory_allocation_warning_threshold

Threshold for log messages that contain a larger memory allocation than specified.

*Unit:* bytes

*Optional:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `131073` (128_kib + 1)

---

=== node_id

A number that uniquely identifies the broker within the cluster. If `null` (the default value), Redpanda automatically assigns an ID. If set, it must be non-negative value.

CAUTION: The `node_id` property must not be changed after a broker joins the cluster.


*Accepted values:* [`0`, `4294967295`]

*Type:* integer

*Optional:* No

*Visibility:* `user`

*Default:* `null`

---

=== rack

A label that identifies a failure zone. Apply the same label to all brokers in the same failure zone. When xref:./cluster-properties.adoc#enable_rack_awareness[enable_rack_awareness] is set to `true` at the cluster level, the system uses the rack labels to spread partition replicas across different failure zones.

*Optional:* No

*Visibility:* `user`

*Default:* `null`

---

=== recovery_mode_enabled

If `true`, start Redpanda in xref:manage:recovery-mode.adoc[recovery mode], where user partitions are not loaded and only administrative operations are allowed.

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* boolean

*Default:* `false`

---

=== rpc_server

IP address and port for the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) server.

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `user`

*Default:* `127.0.0.1:33145`

---

=== rpc_server_tls

TLS configuration for the RPC server.

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `user`

---

=== seed_servers

List of the seed servers used to join current cluster. If the `seed_servers` list is empty the node will be a cluster root and it will form a new cluster.

* When `empty_seed_starts_cluster` is `true`, Redpanda enables one broker with an empty `seed_servers` list to initiate a new cluster. The broker with an empty `seed_servers` becomes the cluster root, to which other brokers must connect to join the cluster.  Brokers looking to join the cluster should have their `seed_servers` populated with the cluster root's address, facilitating their connection to the cluster.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Only one broker, the designated cluster root, should have an empty `seed_servers` list during the initial cluster bootstrapping. This ensures a single initiation point for cluster formation.
====

* When `empty_seed_starts_cluster` is `false`, Redpanda requires all brokers to start with a known set of brokers listed in `seed_servers`. The `seed_servers` list must not be empty and should be identical across these initial seed brokers, containing the addresses of all seed brokers. Brokers not included in the `seed_servers` list use it to discover and join the cluster, allowing for expansion beyond the foundational members.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `seed_servers` list must be consistent across all seed brokers to prevent cluster fragmentation and ensure stable cluster formation.
====

*Visibility:* `user`

*Type:* array
