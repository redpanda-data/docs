= Node Configuration Properties
:description: Node configuration properties list.

Node configuration properties are applied individually to each node in a cluster. The following describes each node configuration property, with its default setting if applicable.

IMPORTANT: After you change a node-level property setting, you must restart the node for the change to take effect.

After you change a node-level property setting, you must restart the node for the change to take effect.

To learn how to set these properties from studying a sample configuration file, see the xref:./node-configuration-sample.adoc[node configuration sample].

== Required properties

CAUTION: You must include the following required properties in your configuration. If you omit them, Redpanda will not start.

=== data_directory

Path to the directory for storing Redpanda's streaming data files.

---

== Optional properties

=== admin

IP address and port of the admin server.

*Default*: 127.0.0.1:9644

---

=== admin_api_doc_dir

Path to the admin API documentation directory.

*Default*: /usr/share/redpanda/admin-api-doc

---

=== admin_api_tls

TLS configuration for the Admin API.

*Default*: null

---

=== advertised_kafka_api

Addresses of Kafka API published to clients.

*Default*: empty array

---

=== advertised_rpc_api

Address of the RPC endpoint published to other cluster members.

*Default*: null

---

=== cloud_storage_cache_directory

The directory where the cache archive is stored. This property is mandatory when xref:./cluster-properties.adoc#cloud_storage_enabled[cloud_storage_enabled] is set to `true`.

*Default*: null

---

=== coproc_supervisor_server

IP address and port for supervisor service.

*Default*: 127.0.0.1:43189

---

=== crash_loop_limit

A limit on the number of consecutive times a broker can crash within one hour before its crash-tracking logic is reset. This limit prevents a broker from getting stuck in an infinite cycle of crashes.

If `null`, the property is disabled and no limit is applied.

The crash-tracking logic is reset (to zero consecutive crashes) by any of the following conditions:

* The node shuts down cleanly.
* One hour elapses since the last crash.
* The node configuration file, `redpanda.yaml`, is updated.
* The `startup_log` file in the node's <<data_directory,data_directory>> is manually deleted.

*Units*: number of consecutive crashes of a node

*Default*: 5

---

=== dashboard_dir

Path to the directory where the HTTP dashboard is located.

*Default*: null

---

=== developer_mode

CAUTION: Enabling `developer_mode` isn't recommended for production use.

Flag to enable developer mode, which skips most of the checks performed at startup.

*Default*: false

---

=== empty_seed_starts_cluster

Controls how a new cluster is formed. This property must have the same value in all nodes in a cluster.

If `true`, an empty <<seed_servers,seed_servers>> list will denote that this node should form a cluster. At most, one node in the cluster should be configured with an empty seed_servers list. If no such configured node exists, or if configured to be `false`, all nodes denoted by the seed_servers list must be identical among those nodes' configurations, and those nodes will form the initial cluster.

TIP: While it's set `true` by default for backward compatibility, Redpanda recommends that you set `empty_seed_starts_cluster` to `false`.

*Default*: true

---

=== kafka_api

IP address and port of the Kafka API endpoint that handles requests.

*Default*: 127.0.0.1:9092

---

=== kafka_api_tls

Transport Layer Security (TLS) configuration for the Kafka API endpoint.

*Default*: null

---

=== large_allocation_warning_threshold

Enables log warning messages for memory allocations greater than the given threshold size, in bytes.

If set to `null`, the property is disabled, so no log messages are enabled.

If enabled, the log warnings are rate limited: the first warning will be for any allocation greater than or equal to the configured threshold, then for every subsequent warning the threshold is increased by 1.618x the current threshold.

*Units*: bytes per memory allocation

*Default*: null

---

=== node_id

A number that uniquely identifies the node within the cluster. If `null` (the default value), Redpanda automatically assigns an ID. If set, it must be non-negative value.

CAUTION: The `node_id` property mustn't be changed after a node joins the cluster.

*Default*: null

*Range*: [0, ...]

---

=== rack

A label that identifies a failure zone. Apply the same label to all nodes in the same failure zone. When xref:./cluster-properties.adoc#enable_rack_awareness[enable_rack_awareness] is set to `true` at the cluster level, the system uses the rack labels to spread partition replicas across different failure zones.

*Default*: null

---

=== rpc_server

IP address and port for the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) server.

*Default*: 127.0.0.1:33145

---

=== rpc_server_tls

TLS configuration for the RPC server.

*Default*: null

---

=== seed_servers

List of seed servers used to join an existing cluster.

If a cluster does not already exist:

* When <<empty_seed_starts_cluster,empty_seed_starts_cluster>> is `true`, if the seed_servers list is empty, this node will be the cluster root to form a new cluster that other nodes subsequently join. Exactly one node in the cluster should set seed_servers to be empty when first bootstrapping a cluster. For nodes that are not the root node, this is the list of nodes used to join the cluster.
* Otherwise, when <<empty_seed_starts_cluster,empty_seed_starts_cluster>> is `false`, this refers to the list of nodes that initially bootstrap the cluster. In this case, seed_servers cannot be empty, and seed_servers must be identical for all nodes in that list. For nodes not in the seed_servers list, this is the list of nodes used to join the cluster.

*Default*: null
