= Internal Metrics Reference
:description: Reference of Redpanda internal metrics for detailed analysis, debugging, and troubleshooting.

This section provides reference descriptions about the internal metrics exported from Redpanda's `/metrics` endpoint.

include::shared:partial$metrics-usage-tip.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
In a live system, Redpanda metrics are exported only for features that are in use. For example, a metric for consumer groups is not exported when no groups are registered.

To see the available internal metrics in your system, query the `/metrics` endpoint:

[,bash]
----
curl http://<node-addr>:9644/metrics | grep "[HELP|TYPE]"

== Internal metrics

Most internal metrics are useful for debugging. The following subset of internal metrics can be useful to monitor system health.

---

=== vectorized_application_uptime

Redpanda uptime in milliseconds.

---

=== vectorized_cluster_partition_last_stable_offset

Last stable offset.

If this is the last record received by the cluster, then the cluster is up-to-date and ready for maintenance.

---

=== vectorized_cluster_partition_schema_id_validation_records_failed

Number of records that failed schema ID validation.

---

=== vectorized_cluster_partition_start_offset

Raft snapshot start offset.

---

=== vectorized_io_queue_delay

Total delay time in the queue.

Can indicate latency caused by disk operations in seconds.

---

=== vectorized_io_queue_queue_length

Number of requests in the queue.

Can indicate latency caused by disk operations.

---

=== vectorized_kafka_rpc_active_connections

Number of currently active Kafka RPC connections, or clients.

---

=== vectorized_kafka_rpc_connects

Number of accepted Kafka RPC connections.

Compare to the value at a previous time to derive the rate of accepted connections.

---

[[vectorized_kafka_rpc_produce_bad_create_time]]
=== vectorized_kafka_rpc_produce_bad_create_time

An incrementing counter for the number of times a producer created a message with a timestamp skewed from the broker's date and time. This metric is related to the following properties:

* `log_message_timestamp_alert_before_ms`: Increment this gauge when the `create_timestamp` on a message is too far in the past as compared to the broker's time.
* `log_message_timestamp_alert_after_ms`: Increment this gauge when the `create_timestamp` on a message is too far in the future as compared to the broker's time.

---

=== vectorized_kafka_rpc_received_bytes

Number of bytes received from Kafka RPC clients in valid requests.

Compare to the value at a previous time to derive the throughput in Kafka layer in bytes/sec received.

---

=== vectorized_kafka_rpc_requests_completed

Number of successful Kafka RPC requests.

Compare to the value at a previous time to derive the messages per second per shard.

---

=== vectorized_kafka_rpc_requests_pending

Number of Kafka RPC requests being processed by a server.

---

=== vectorized_kafka_rpc_sent_bytes

Number of bytes sent to Kafka RPC clients.

---

=== vectorized_kafka_rpc_service_errors

Number of Kafka RPC service errors.

---

=== vectorized_raft_leadership_changes

Number of leadership changes.

High value can indicate nodes failing and causing leadership changes.

---

=== vectorized_reactor_utilization

Redpanda process utilization.

Shows the true utilization of the CPU by a Redpanda process.

---

=== vectorized_storage_log_compacted_segment

Number of compacted segments.

---

=== vectorized_storage_log_log_segments_created

Number of created log segments.

---

=== vectorized_storage_log_partition_size

Current size of partition in bytes.

---

=== vectorized_storage_log_read_bytes

Total number of bytes read.

---

=== vectorized_storage_log_written_bytes

Total number of bytes written.
