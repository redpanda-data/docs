:description: Redpanda internal metrics for detailed analysis, debugging, and troubleshooting.
:page-aliases: reference:internal-metrics.adoc

This section provides reference descriptions about the internal metrics exported from Redpanda's `/metrics` endpoint.

include::shared:partial$metrics-usage-tip.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
In a live system, Redpanda metrics are exported only for features that are in use. For example, a metric for consumer groups is not exported when no groups are registered.

To see the available internal metrics in your system, query the `/metrics` endpoint:
