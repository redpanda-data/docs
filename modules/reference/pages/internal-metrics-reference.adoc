:description: Reference of Redpanda internal metrics for detailed analysis, debugging, and troubleshooting.

This section provides reference descriptions about the internal metrics exported from Redpanda's `/metrics` endpoint.

include::shared:partial$metrics-usage-tip.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
In a live system, Redpanda metrics are exported only for features that are in use. For example, a metric for consumer groups is not exported when no groups are registered.

To see the available internal metrics in your system, query the `/metrics` endpoint:

[,bash]

curl http://<node-addr>:9644/metrics | grep "[HELP|TYPE]"

== Internal metrics

Most internal metrics are useful for debugging. The following subset of internal metrics can be useful to monitor system health.

---

=== vectorized_application_uptime

Redpanda uptime in milliseconds.

---

=== vectorized_cloud_storage_read_bytes

Number of bytes Redpanda has read from cloud storage. This is tracked on a per-topic and per-partition basis, and increments each time a cloud storage read operation successfully completes.

---

=== vectorized_cluster_partition_last_stable_offset

Last stable offset.

If this is the last record received by the cluster, then the cluster is up-to-date and ready for maintenance.

---

=== vectorized_cluster_partition_schema_id_validation_records_failed

Number of records that failed schema ID validation.

---

=== vectorized_cluster_partition_start_offset

Raft snapshot start offset.

---

=== vectorized_io_queue_delay

Total delay time in the queue.

Can indicate latency caused by disk operations in seconds.

---

=== vectorized_io_queue_queue_length

Number of requests in the queue.

Can indicate latency caused by disk operations.

---

=== vectorized_kafka_quotas_balancer_runs

Number of times the throughput quota balancer has executed.

*Type*: counter

---

=== vectorized_kafka_quotas_quota_effective

Current effective quota for the quota balancer, in bytes per second.

*Type*: counter

---

=== vectorized_kafka_quotas_client_quota_throttle_time

Client quota throttling delay, in seconds, per rule and quota type based on xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/manage-throughput.adoc#client-throughput-limits[client throughput limits].

*Type*: histogram

*Labels*:

* `quota_rule=("not_applicable" | "kafka_client_default" | "cluster_client_default" | "kafka_client_prefix" | "cluster_client_prefix" | "kafka_client_id")`
* `quota_type=("produce_quota" | "fetch_quota" | "partition_mutation_quota")`

---

=== vectorized_kafka_quotas_client_quota_throughput

Client quota throughput per rule and quota type.

*Type*: histogram

*Labels*:

* `quota_rule=("not_applicable" | "kafka_client_default" | "cluster_client_default" | "kafka_client_prefix" | "cluster_client_prefix" | "kafka_client_id")`
* `quota_type=("produce_quota" | "fetch_quota" | "partition_mutation_quota")`

---

=== vectorized_kafka_quotas_throttle_time

Histogram of throttle times, in seconds, based on xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/manage-throughput.adoc#broker-wide-throughput-limits[broker-wide throughput limits].

*Type*: histogram

---

=== vectorized_kafka_quotas_traffic_intake

Total amount of Kafka traffic (in bytes) taken in from clients for processing that was considered by the throttler.

*Type*: counter

---

=== vectorized_kafka_quotas_traffic_egress

Total amount of Kafka traffic (in bytes) published to clients that was considered by the throttler.

*Type*: counter

---

=== vectorized_kafka_rpc_active_connections

Number of currently active Kafka RPC connections, or clients.

---

=== vectorized_kafka_rpc_connects

Number of accepted Kafka RPC connections.

Compare to the value at a previous time to derive the rate of accepted connections.

---

[[vectorized_kafka_rpc_produce_bad_create_time]]
=== vectorized_kafka_rpc_produce_bad_create_time

An incrementing counter for the number of times a producer created a message with a timestamp skewed from the broker's date and time. This metric is related to the following properties:

* `log_message_timestamp_alert_before_ms`: Increment this gauge when the `create_timestamp` on a message is too far in the past as compared to the broker's time.
* `log_message_timestamp_alert_after_ms`: Increment this gauge when the `create_timestamp` on a message is too far in the future as compared to the broker's time.

---

=== vectorized_kafka_rpc_received_bytes

Number of bytes received from Kafka RPC clients in valid requests.

Compare to the value at a previous time to derive the throughput in Kafka layer in bytes/sec received.

---

=== vectorized_kafka_rpc_requests_completed

Number of successful Kafka RPC requests.

Compare to the value at a previous time to derive the messages per second per shard.

---

=== vectorized_kafka_rpc_requests_pending

Number of Kafka RPC requests being processed by a server.

---

=== vectorized_kafka_rpc_sent_bytes

Number of bytes sent to Kafka RPC clients.

---

=== vectorized_kafka_rpc_service_errors

Number of Kafka RPC service errors.

---

=== vectorized_ntp_archiver_compacted_replaced_bytes

Number of bytes removed from cloud storage by compaction operations. This is tracked on a per-topic and per-partition basis.

This metric resets every time partition leadership changes. It tracks whether or not compaction is performing operations on cloud storage.

The `namespace` label supports the following options for this metric:

* `kafka` - User topics
* `kafka_internal` - Internal Kafka topic, such as consumer groups
* `redpanda` - Redpanda-only internal data

*Labels*:

* `namespace=("kafka" | "kafka_internal" | "redpanda")`
* `topic`
* `partition`

---

=== vectorized_ntp_archiver_pending

The difference between the last committed offset and the last offset uploaded to Tiered Storage for each partition. A value of zero for this metric indicates that all data for a partition is uploaded to Tiered Storage.

This metric is impacted by the xref:reference:tunable-properties.adoc#cloud_storage_segment_max_upload_interval_sec[`cloud_storage_segment_max_upload_interval_sec`] tunable property. If this interval is set to 5 minutes, the archiver will upload committed segments to Tiered Storage every 5 minutes or less. If this metric continues growing for longer than the configured interval, it can indicate a potential network issue with the upload path for that partition.

The `namespace` label supports the following options for this metric:

* `kafka` - User topics
* `kafka_internal` - Internal Kafka topic, such as consumer groups
* `redpanda` - Redpanda-only internal data

*Labels*:

* `namespace=("kafka" | "kafka_internal" | "redpanda")`
* `topic`
* `partition`

---

=== vectorized_raft_leadership_changes

Number of leadership changes.

High value can indicate nodes failing and causing leadership changes.

---

=== vectorized_reactor_utilization

Redpanda process utilization.

Shows the true utilization of the CPU by a Redpanda process.

---

=== vectorized_storage_log_compacted_segment

Number of compacted segments.

---

=== vectorized_storage_log_compaction_removed_bytes

Number of bytes removed from local storage by compaction operations. This is tracked on a per-topic and per-partition basis. It tracks whether compaction is performing operations on local storage.

The `namespace` label supports the following options for this metric:

* `kafka` - User topics
* `kafka_internal` - Internal Kafka topic, such as consumer groups
* `redpanda` - Redpanda-only internal data

*Labels*:

* `namespace=("kafka" | "kafka_internal" | "redpanda")`
* `topic`
* `partition`

---

=== vectorized_storage_log_log_segments_created

Number of created log segments.

---

=== vectorized_storage_log_partition_size

Current size of partition in bytes.

---

=== vectorized_storage_log_read_bytes

Total number of bytes read.

---

=== vectorized_storage_log_written_bytes

Total number of bytes written.
