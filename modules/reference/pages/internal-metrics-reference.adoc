= Internal Metrics
:description: Redpanda internal metrics for detailed analysis, debugging, and troubleshooting.
:page-aliases: reference:internal-metrics.adoc

This section provides reference descriptions about the internal metrics exported from Redpanda's `/metrics` endpoint.

include::shared:partial$metrics-usage-tip.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
In a live system, Redpanda metrics are exported only for features that are in use. For example, a metric for consumer groups is not exported when no groups are registered.

To see the available internal metrics in your system, query the `/metrics` endpoint:

[,bash]
----
curl http://<node-addr>:9644/metrics | grep "[HELP|TYPE]"
----
====

Internal metrics (`/metrics`) can generate thousands of metric series in production environments, so use them judiciously in monitoring systems to avoid performance issues. For alerting and dashboards, public metrics are preferable (`/public_metrics`) because they are optimized for lower cardinality.

The xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#aggregate_metrics[aggregate_metrics] cluster property controls internal metrics cardinality. When you enable this property, internal metrics combine labels (like shard) to reduce the number of series. Public metrics always combine labels, regardless of this setting.
