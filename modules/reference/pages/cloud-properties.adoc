*Type*: boolean

*Default*: false

*Restart required*: yes

=== cloud_storage_max_connections

Max number of simultaneous connections to S3 per shard. Includes connections used for both uploads and downloads.

*Units*: number of simultaneous connections

---

=== cloud_storage_recovery_topic_validation_mode

Validation performed before recovering a topic from cloud storage. In case of failure, the reason for the failure appears as `ERROR` lines in the Redpanda application log. For each topic, this reports errors for all partitions, but for each partition, only the first error is reported.

This property accepts the following parameters:

- `no_check`: Skips the checks for topic recovery.
- `check_manifest_existence`:  Runs an existence check on each `partition_manifest`. Fails if there are connection issues to the cloud storage.
- `check_manifest_and_segment_metadata`: Download the manifest and run a consistency check, comparing the metadata with the cloud storage objects. The process will fail if any metadata references missing cloud storage objects.

Example: Redpanda validates the topic `kafka/panda-topic-recovery-NOT-OK` and stops due to a fatal error on partition 0:

```bash
ERROR 2024-04-24 21:29:08,166 [shard 1:main] cluster - [fiber11|0|299996ms recovery validation of {kafka/panda-topic-recovery-NOT-OK/0}/24] - manifest metadata check: missing segment, validation not ok
ERROR 2024-04-24 21:29:08,166 [shard 1:main] cluster - topics_frontend.cc:519 - Stopping recovery of {kafka/panda-topic-recovery-NOT-OK} due to validation error
```

Each failing partition error message has the following format:

```bash
ERROR .... [... recovery validation of {<namespace/topic/partition>}...] - <failure-reason>, validation not ok
```

At the end of the process, Redpanda outputs a final ERROR message: 

```bash
ERROR ... ... - Stopping recovery of {<namespace/topic>} due to validation error
```

When the spillover manifest is materialized and stored in the cache and the cache needs to evict it, it will use 'cloud_storage_materialized_manifest_ttl_ms' value as a timeout. The cursor that uses the spillover manifest uses this value as a TTL interval after which it stops referencing the manifest making it available for eviction. This only affects spillover manifests under contention.

*Requires restart:* No

*Optional:* Yes

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Accepted values:* [`-17592186044416`, `17592186044415`]

---

=== cloud_storage_max_concurrent_hydrations_per_shard

Maximum concurrent segment hydrations of remote data per CPU core.  If unset, value of `cloud_storage_max_connections / 2` is used, which means that half of available S3 bandwidth could be used to download data from S3. If the cloud storage cache is empty every new segment reader will require a download. This will lead to 1:1 mapping between number of partitions scanned by the fetch request and number of parallel downloads. If this value is too large the downloads can affect other workloads. In case of any problem caused by the tiered-storage reads this value can be lowered. This will only affect segment hydrations (downloads) but won't affect cached segments. If fetch request is reading from the tiered-storage cache its concurrency will only be limited by available memory.

=== cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_max_segments

Maximum number of segments in the spillover manifest that can be offloaded to the object storage. This setting serves as a threshold for triggering data offload based on the number of segments, rather than the total size of the manifest. It is designed for use in testing environments to control the offload behavior more granularly. In production settings, manage offloads based on the manifest size through `cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_size` for more predictable outcomes.

*Requires restart:* No

*Optional:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `null`

---

=== cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_size

The size of the manifest which can be offloaded to the cloud. If the size of the local manifest stored in Redpanda exceeds `cloud_storage_spillover_manifest_size` by two times the spillover mechanism will split the manifest into two parts and one will be uploaded to S3.

*Requires restart:* No

*Optional:* No

*Visibility:* `tunable`

*Type:* integer

*Default:* `65536`

---

=== cloud_storage_throughput_limit_percent

Maximum throughput used by Tiered Storage per broker expressed as a percentage of the disk bandwidth. If the server has several disks, Redpanda will use the one that stores the Tiered Storage cache. Even if the Tiered Storage is allowed to use the full bandwidth of the disk (100%) it won't necessarily use it in full. The actual usage depends on your workload and the state of the Tiered Storage cache. This setting is a safeguard that prevents Tiered Storage from using too many system resources and is not a performance tuning knob.

*Requires restart:* No
