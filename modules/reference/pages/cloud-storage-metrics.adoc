== Prerequisites

Cloud storage metrics are only enabled if you have:
- Tiered Storage enabled
- The cluster property xref:./cluster-properties.adoc#cloud_storage_enabled[cloud_storage_enabled] is set to `true`

=== redpanda_cloud_storage_jobs_local_segment_reuploads

Number of segment reuploads from local data directory

=== redpanda_cloud_storage_cache_trim_failed_trims

Number of times could not free the expected amount of space, indicating possible bug or configuration issue

=== redpanda_cloud_storage_cache_trim_exhaustive_trims

=== redpanda_cloud_storage_cache_space_hwm_files

High watermark of number of objects in cache

=== redpanda_cloud_storage_cache_op_in_progress_files
