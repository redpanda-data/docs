= Redpanda Cloud Shared Responsibility Model
:description: Redpanda Cloud Shared Responsibility Model

The Redpanda Cloud shared responsibility model clarifies cloud resource ownership between Redpanda and customers with respect to infrastructure, security, and Redpanda service.

Since BYOC is a fully managed offering running in customers' cloud accounts, a small set of responsibilities are shared. However, we strive to ensure the user experience is and remains a smooth SaaS experience.

The following table shows the shared responsibility model across our current cloud offerings.
