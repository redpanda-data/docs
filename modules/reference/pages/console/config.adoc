= Redpanda Console Configuration
:description: Redpanda Console configuration YAML template with property descriptions.
:page-aliases: console:reference/config.adoc

When you install Redpanda Console, a `redpanda-console-config.yaml` file is installed on each instance in `/etc/redpanda/redpanda-console-config.yaml`. This file contains configuration properties for Redpanda Console.

== Configuration sources

Redpanda Console loads configuration properties from three sources, with the following order of precedence:

* Environment variables
* YAML configuration
* Command line arguments (flags)
This means that environment variables and YAML configurations can overwrite input that is set on the command line.

=== YAML configuration

The recommended configuration source is a YAML file. Specify the path to the file by either setting
the `-config.filepath` flag or setting the `CONFIG_FILEPATH` environment variable.
A reference YAML configuration file is provided under <<sample-configuration,Sample configuration>>.

=== Environment variables

Configuration options can be configured using environment variables. The key for the environment
variable is auto-generated by converting the YAML equivalent to uppercase and adding an underscore for each indentation level. For example:

* kafka.rackId \=> KAFKA_RACKID
* kafka.tls.caFilepath \=> KAFKA_TLS_CAFILEPATH

For configuration properties that expect a list of values, use commas between each value. For example:

* KAFKA_BROKERS=redpanda-0:9092,redpanda-1:9092,redpanda-2:9092

:::important
You cannot use environment variables to configure object arrays, such as the configuration
for Kafka connect clusters. In this case, use a YAML file, and provide secrets using environment variables or command line arguments.
:::

== Sample configuration

The following `config.yaml` configuration file contains a complete list of all Console configuration properties and their descriptions. All values are default values.

Provide the filepath to your configuration file by setting either the flag
`-config.filepath` or the environment variable `CONFIG_FILEPATH`.

[CAUTION]
====
* Ensure that all values entered are properly enclosed in quotes and escaped as necessary. For example, put passwords with special characters in single quotes.
* This configuration file contains both Redpanda Enterprise and Redpanda Community configurations. If you don't provide a enterprise license, Console ignores configurations for enterprise features.
