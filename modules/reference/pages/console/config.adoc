:page-categories: Redpanda Console

When you install Redpanda Console, a `redpanda-console-config.yaml` file is installed on each instance in `/etc/redpanda/redpanda-console-config.yaml`. This file contains configuration properties for Redpanda Console.

== Configuration sources

Redpanda Console loads configuration properties from three sources, in the following order of precedence:

* Environment variables
* YAML configuration (recommended)
* Command-line arguments

Environment variables and YAML configurations can overwrite input that is set on the command line.

=== YAML configuration

The recommended configuration source is a YAML file. Specify the path to the file by either setting
the `-config.filepath` flag or setting the `CONFIG_FILEPATH` environment variable.
A reference configuration file is provided under <<Redpanda Console configuration file>>.

=== Environment variables

Configuration options can be configured using environment variables. The key for the environment
variable is auto-generated by converting the YAML equivalent to uppercase and adding an underscore for each indentation level. For example:

[cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|YAML|Environment Variable

|kafka.rackId
|KAFKA_RACKID

|kafka.tls.caFilepath
|KAFKA_TLS_CAFILEPATH
|===

For configuration properties that expect a list of values, use commas between each value. For example:

[,bash]
----
KAFKA_BROKERS=redpanda-0:9092,redpanda-1:9092,redpanda-2:9092
----

NOTE: You cannot use environment variables to configure object arrays, such as the configuration
for Kafka connect clusters. In this case, use a YAML file, and provide secrets using environment variables or command line arguments.

== Redpanda Console configuration file

The following `redpanda-console-config.yaml` file contains a complete list of all Redpanda Console configuration properties and their descriptions. All values are default values.

Provide the filepath to your configuration file by setting either the `-config.filepath` flag or the `CONFIG_FILEPATH` environment variable.

[CAUTION]
====
* Where necessary, ensure that values are enclosed in quotes and escaped. For example, put passwords with special characters in single quotes.
* This configuration file contains both Redpanda Enterprise and Redpanda Community configurations. If you don't provide an Enterprise license, Redpanda Console ignores configurations for enterprise features.
