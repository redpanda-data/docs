= Cluster Configuration Properties
:description: Cluster configuration properties list.

Cluster configuration properties are the same for all brokers in a cluster. They can be set at the cluster level.

For information on how to edit cluster properties, see xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/cluster-property-configuration.adoc[Configuring Cluster Properties]. Some properties require the cluster to be restarted in order to be applied; see a specific property's reference for whether restart is required.

Whether admin API clients must provide HTTP basic authentication headers.

*Default*: false

*Restart required*: no

---

=== superusers

List of superuser usernames.

*Default*: null

*Restart required*: no

---

== Audit logging properties

[[audit_enabled]]
=== audit_enabled

Enables or disables audit logging. When you set this to true, Redpanda checks for an existing topic named `_redpanda.audit_log`. If none is found, Redpanda automatically creates one for you.

*Default*: `false`

*Restart required*: no

---

[[audit_enabled_event_types]]
=== audit_enabled_event_types

List of strings in JSON style identifying the event types to include in the audit log. This may include any of the following - `management, produce, consume, describe, heartbeat, authenticate, schema_registry, admin`.

*Default*: `'["management","authenticate","admin"]'`

*Restart required*: no

---

[[audit_exclude_principals]]
=== audit_exclude_principals

List of strings in JSON style identifying the principals the audit logging system should ignore. Principals can be listed as `User:name` or `name`, both are accepted.

*Default*: null

*Restart required*: no

---

[[audit_exclude_topics]]
=== audit_exclude_topics

List of strings in JSON style identifying the topics the audit logging system should ignore. This list cannot include the `_redpanda.audit_log` topic. Redpanda will reject the command if you do attempt to include that topic.

*Default*: null

*Restart required*: no

---

[[audit_client_max_buffer_size]]
=== audit_client_max_buffer_size

Defines the number of bytes allocated by the internal audit client for audit messages. When changing this, you must disable audit logging and then re-enable it for the change to take effect. Consider increasing this if your system generates a very large number of audit records in a short amount of time.

*Default*: `16777216`

*Restart required*: No, but audit `audit_enabled` must be toggled to `false` then back to `true` if it's currently enabled.

---

[[audit_log_num_partitions]]
=== audit_log_num_partitions

Defines the number of partitions used by a newly created audit topic. This configuration applies only to the audit log topic and may be different from the cluster or other topic configurations. This cannot be altered for existing audit log topics.

*Default*: `12`

*Restart required*: no

---

[[audit_log_replication_factor]]
=== audit_log_replication_factor

Defines the replication factor for a newly created audit log topic. This configuration applies only to the audit log topic and may be different from the cluster or other topic configurations. This cannot be altered for existing audit log topics. Setting this value is optional. If a value is not provided, Redpanda will use the `internal_topic_replication_factor` cluster config value.

*Default*: `null`

*Restart required*: no

---

[[audit_queue_drain_interval_ms]]
=== audit_queue_drain_interval_ms

Internally, Redpanda batches audit log messages in memory and periodically writes them to the audit log topic. This defines the period in milliseconds between draining this queue to the audit log topic. Longer intervals may help prevent duplicate messages, especially in high throughput scenarios, but they also increase the risk of data loss during hard shutdowns where the queue is lost.

*Default*: `500`

*Restart required*: no

---

[[audit_queue_max_buffer_size_per_shard]]
=== audit_queue_max_buffer_size_per_shard

---

=== kafka_quota_balancer_node_period_ms

The period at which the intra-node throughput quota balancer runs.

It may take longer for the balancer to complete a single balancing step than the period this property specifies, so the actual period may be more than configured here.

If `0`, the balancer is disabled and all throughput quotas are immutable.

*Units*: milliseconds

*Default*: 750

*Range*: [0, ]

*Restart required*: no

*Related topics*:

* xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/manage-throughput.adoc#node-wide-throughput-limits[Node-wide throughput limits]

*Supported versions*: Redpanda v23.1 or later

---

=== kafka_quota_balancer_min_shard_throughput_ratio

The minimum value of the throughput quota a shard can get in the process of quota balancing, expressed as a ratio of default shard quota. While the value applies equally to ingress and egress traffic, the default shard quota can be different for ingress and egress and therefore result in different minimum throughput bytes-per-second (bps) values.

Both `kafka_quota_balancer_min_shard_throughput_ratio` and <<kafka_quota_balancer_min_shard_throughput_bps,kafka_quota_balancer_min_shard_throughput_bps>> can be specified at the same time. In this case, the balancer will not decrease the effective shard quota below the largest bps value of each of these two properties.

If set to `0.0`, the minimum is disabled. If set to `1.0`, then the balancer won't be able to rebalance quota without violating this ratio, consequently precluding the balancer from adjusting shards' quotas.

*Type*: double

*Units*: ratio of default shard quota

*Default*: 0.01

*Range*: [0.0, 1.0]

*Restart required*: no

*Related topics*:

* xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/manage-throughput.adoc#node-wide-throughput-limits[Node-wide throughput limits]

*Supported versions*: Redpanda v23.1 or later

---

=== kafka_quota_balancer_min_shard_throughput_bps

The minimum value of the throughput quota a shard can get in the process of quota balancing, expressed in bytes per second. The value applies equally to ingress and egress traffic.

kafka_quota_balancer_min_shard_throughput_bps doesn't override the limit settings, <<kafka_throughput_limit_node_in_bps,kafka_throughput_limit_node_in_bps>> and <<kafka_throughput_limit_node_out_bps,kafka_throughput_limit_node_out_bps>>. Consequently, the value of
`kafka_throughput_limit_node_in_bps` or `kafka_throughput_limit_node_out_bps` can result in lesser throughput than kafka_quota_balancer_min_shard_throughput_bps.

Both <<kafka_quota_balancer_min_shard_throughput_ratio,kafka_quota_balancer_min_shard_throughput_ratio>> and kafka_quota_balancer_min_shard_throughput_bps can be specified at the same time. In this case, the balancer will not decrease the effective shard quota below the largest bps value of each of these two properties.

If set to `0`, no minimum is enforced.

*Units*: bytes per second

*Default*: 256

=== raft_learner_recovery_rate

Raft learner recovery rate limit. Throttles the rate of data communicated to nodes (learners) that need to catch up to leaders.

This rate limit is placed on a node sending data to a recovering node. Each sending node will be limited to this rate. The recovering node will accept data as fast as possible according to the combined limits of all healthy nodes in the cluster. For example, if two nodes are sending data to the recovering node, and `raft_learner_recovery_rate` is 100 MB/sec, then the recovering node will recover at a rate of 200 MB/sec.

---

=== storage_ignore_timestamps_in_future_sec

The maximum number of seconds that a record's timestamp can be ahead of a Redpanda broker's clock and still be used when deciding whether to clean up the record for data retention. This property makes possible the timely cleanup of records from clients with clocks that are drastically unsynchronized relative to Redpanda.

When determining whether to clean up a record with timestamp more than `storage_ignore_timestamps_in_future_sec` seconds ahead of the broker, Redpanda ignores the record's timestamp and instead uses a valid timestamp of another record in the same segment, or (if another record's valid timestamp is unavailable) the timestamp of when the segment file was last modified (mtime).

By default, `storage_ignore_timestamps_in_future_sec` is disabled (null).

[TIP]
====
To figure out whether to set `storage_ignore_timestamps_in_future_sec` for your system:

. Look for logs with segments that are unexpectedly large and not being cleaned up.
. In the logs, search for records with unsynchronized timestamps that are further into the future than tolerable by your data retention and storage settings. For example, timestamps 60 seconds or more into the future can be considered to be too unsynchronized.
. If you find unsynchronized timestamps throughout your logs, determine the number of seconds that the timestamps are ahead of their actual time, and set `storage_ignore_timestamps_in_future_sec` to that value so data retention can proceed.
. If you only find unsynchronized timestamps that are the result of transient behavior, you can disable `storage_ignore_timestamps_in_future_sec`.

[[minimum_topic_replication]]
=== minimum_topic_replication

Minimum allowable replication factor for topics in this cluster. The set value must be positive, odd, and equal to or less than the number of available brokers. Changing this parameter only restricts newly-created topics. Redpanda returns an `INVALID_REPLICATION_FACTOR` error on any attempt to create a topic with a replication factor less than this property.

If you change the `minimum_topic_replication` setting, the replication factor of existing topics remains unchanged. However, Redpanda will log a warning on start-up with a list of any topics that have fewer replicas than this minimum. For example, you might see a message such as `Topic X has a replication factor less than specified minimum: 1 < 3`.
