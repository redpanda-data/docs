:description: See the Schema Registry API, the HTTP Proxy API, and the Admin API.

Use Redpanda's API reference documentation to learn about and interact with API endpoints:

* link:/api/doc/schema-registry/[Schema Registry API Reference]
+
Manage schemas within a Redpanda cluster. See also: xref:manage:schema-reg/index.adoc[Schema Registry documentation].
* link:/api/doc/http-proxy/[HTTP Proxy API Reference]
+
HTTP Proxy is an HTTP server that exposes operations you can perform directly on a Redpanda cluster. Use the Redpanda HTTP Proxy API to perform a subset of actions that are also available through the Kafka API, but using simpler REST operations. See also: xref:develop:http-proxy.adoc[Use Redpanda with the HTTP Proxy API].
* Admin API Reference
+
Manage components of a Redpanda cluster, such as individual brokers and partition leadership. The Redpanda Admin API also allows you to perform operations that are specific to Redpanda Self-Managed and cannot be done using the standard Kafka API. See also: xref:manage:use-admin-api.adoc[].
