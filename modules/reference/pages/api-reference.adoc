* xref:api:ROOT:pandaproxy-schema-registry.adoc[Schema Registry API Reference]

HTTP Proxy is an HTTP server that exposes operations you can perform directly on a Redpanda cluster. Use the Redpanda HTTP Proxy API to perform a subset of actions that are also available through the Kafka API, but using simpler REST operations. See also: xref:ROOT:develop:http-proxy.adoc[Use Redpanda with the HTTP Proxy API].
* xref:api:ROOT:admin-api.adoc[Admin API Reference]
+
Manage components of a Redpanda cluster, such as individual brokers and partition leadership. The Redpanda Admin API also allows you to perform operations that are specific to the Redpanda platform and cannot be done using the standard Kafka API.
