:description: Proxy MCP requests to Remote MCP servers in Redpanda Cloud

// tag::single-source[]

*Introduced in version 25.2.3*.

Proxy MCP requests from your local AI client to a remote MCP server running in your Redpanda Cloud cluster.

This command acts as a bridge between your AI assistant (like Claude) and your remote MCP server. It handles connection management, and request proxying so your AI client can use tools hosted in your cluster.

== Modes of operation

*Install mode* (recommended): Generates and installs MCP client configuration files that tell your AI client how to connect. This is a one-time setup operation.

*Proxy mode* (default): Serves stdio and proxies requests in real-time. Your AI client connects to this command's stdio interface, and requests are forwarded to the remote MCP server.

== Usage

[,bash]
----
rpk cloud mcp proxy [flags]
----

== Examples

Proxy requests to a specific MCP server:

[,bash]
----
rpk cloud mcp proxy --cluster-id <cluster-id> --mcp-server-id <server-id>
----

Install Claude Code configuration:

[,bash]
----
rpk cloud mcp proxy --install --client claude-code --cluster-id <cluster-id> --mcp-server-id <server-id>
----
