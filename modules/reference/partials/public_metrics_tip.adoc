[IMPORTANT]
====
In a live system, Redpanda metrics are exported only for features that are in use. For example, a metric for consumer groups is not exported when no groups are registered.

To see the available public metrics in your system, query the `/public_metrics` endpoint:

[,bash]
----
curl http://<node-addr>:9644/public_metrics | grep "[HELP|TYPE]"
