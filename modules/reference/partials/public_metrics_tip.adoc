====
In a live system, Redpanda metrics are exported only for features that are in use. For example, Redpanda does not export metrics for consumer groups if no groups are registered.

To see the available public metrics in your system, query the `/public_metrics` endpoint:

[,bash]
----
curl http://<node-addr>:9644/public_metrics | grep "[HELP|TYPE]"
