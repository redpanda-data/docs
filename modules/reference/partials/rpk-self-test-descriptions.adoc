Test results are grouped by broker ID. Each test returns the following:

* *Name*: Description of the test.
* *Info*: Details about the test run attached by Redpanda.
* *Type*: Either `disk`, `network`, or `cloud` test.
* *Test Id*: Unique identifier given to jobs of a run. All IDs in a test should match. If they don't match, then newer and/or older test results have been included erroneously.
* *Timeouts*: Number of timeouts incurred during the test.
* *Start time*: Time that the test started, in UTC.
* *End time*: Time that the test ended, in UTC.
* *Avg Duration*: Duration of the test.
* *IOPS*: Number of operations per second. For disk, it's `seastar::dma_read` and `seastar::dma_write`. For network, it's `rpc.send()`.
* *Throughput*: For disk, throughput rate is in bytes per second. For network, throughput rate is in bits per second. Note that GiB vs. Gib is the correct notation displayed by the UI.
* *Latency*: 50th, 90th, etc. percentiles of operation latency, reported in microseconds (Î¼s). Represented as P50, P90, P99, P999, and MAX respectively.
