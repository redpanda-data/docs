Redpanda installs an agent service in your BYOC cluster. The agent
then provisions infrastructure and, eventually, a full
Redpanda cluster. The command downloads the `byoc` plugin from Redpanda Cloud and can execute many operations.

The BYOC command runs Terraform to create and start the agent. You first need
a `redpanda-id` (or cluster ID); this is used to get the details of how your
agent should be provisioned. You can create a BYOC cluster in the Redpanda Cloud UI
and then come back to this command to complete the process.
