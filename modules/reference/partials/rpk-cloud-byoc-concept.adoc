Redpanda installs an agent service in your BYOC cluster. The agent
then provisions infrastructure and, eventually, a full
Redpanda cluster. The command downloads the `byoc` plugin from Redpanda Cloud.

The BYOC command runs Terraform to create and start the agent. You first need
a `redpanda-id` (or cluster ID); this is used to get the details of how your
agent should be provisioned. 

NOTE: To create a BYOC cluster, follow the instructions in the Redpanda Cloud UI. The UI contains the parameters necessary to run `rpk cloud byoc apply` with your cloud provider.
