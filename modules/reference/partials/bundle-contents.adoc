NOTE: Redpanda collects some data from the Kubernetes API.
To communicate with the Kubernetes API, Redpanda requires a ClusterRole attached to the default ServiceAccount for the Pods.
The files and directories that are generated only when the ClusterRole exists are labeled *Requires ClusterRole*.

| `/proc`
| CPU details of the broker on which the `rpk debug bundle` command was executed. +
The directory includes a `cpuinfo` file with CPU information such as processor model, core count, cache size, frequency, as well as an `interrupts` file that contains IRQ distribution across CPU cores.

| `redpanda.yaml`
| The Redpanda configuration file of the broker on which the `rpk debug bundle` command was executed. +
Sensitive data is removed and replaced with `(REDACTED)`.

| `resource-usage.json`
| Redpanda resource usage data, such as CPU usage and free memory available.

| `/utils`
a| Data from the node on which the broker is running. This directory includes:

- `du.txt`: The disk usage of the data directory of the broker on which the `rpk debug bundle` command was executed, as output by the `du` command.
- `ntp.txt`: The NTP clock delta (using https://www.ntppool.org/en/[`ntppool`] as a reference) and round trip time of the broker on which the `rpk debug bundle` command was executed.
- `uname.txt`: System information, such as the kernel version, hostname, and architecture, as output by the `uname` command.
