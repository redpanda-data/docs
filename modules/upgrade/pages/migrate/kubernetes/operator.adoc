The Cluster and Console Custom Resources are deprecated.

To ensure compatibility with future versions of Redpanda and to benefit from new features, enhancements, and security updates, you must migrate from the deprecated Cluster and Console custom resources to the Redpanda custom resource. The migration process involves the following steps:

. <<Deploy the updated Redpanda Operator, Deploy at least version 23.2 of the updated Redpanda Operator>> in the same Kubernetes cluster as your deprecated Redpanda Operator.
. <<Prepare existing Kubernetes resources>>.
. <<Migrate Cluster and Console resources to Redpanda resources>>.

CAUTION: Before implementing any changes in your production environment, Redpanda Data recommends testing the migration in a non-production environment.

== Prerequisites

Before migrating to the Redpanda Operator, you must have the name of your Cluster resource and the namespace in which it's deployed. If you have multiple clusters, migrate one at a time.

```bash
kubectl get cluster -A
```

Example output:

[.no-copy]
----
NAMESPACE   NAME                AGE
redpanda    one-node-external   17m
----

If you also have a Console resource, you need the name of your Console resource and the namespace in which it's deployed:

```bash
kubectl get console -A
```

== Deploy the updated Redpanda Operator

The first step in the migration process is to deploy the updated Redpanda Operator in the same namespace as an existing Cluster resource.

. Make sure that you have permission to install custom resource definitions (CRDs):
+
```bash
kubectl auth can-i create CustomResourceDefinition --all-namespaces
```
+
You should see `yes` in the output.
+
You need cluster-level permissions to install the Redpanda Operator CRDs in the next steps.

. Install the Redpanda Operator custom resource definitions (CRDs):
+
include::deploy:partial$kubernetes/install-crds.adoc[]

. Install the Redpanda Operator *in the same namespace as your Cluster custom resource*:
+
[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
helm repo add redpanda https://charts.redpanda.com
helm upgrade --install redpanda-controller redpanda/operator \
  --namespace <namespace> \
  --set image.tag={latest-operator-version} \
  --create-namespace
----

. Ensure that the Deployment is successfully rolled out:
+
```bash
kubectl --namespace <namespace> rollout status -w deployment/redpanda-controller-operator
```
+
[.no-copy]
----
deployment "redpanda-controller" successfully rolled out
----

== Prepare existing Kubernetes resources

After you've deployed the updated Redpanda Operator, you must stop the deprecated Redpanda Operator from reconciling the deprecated resources and adopt some existing Kubernetes resources that are part of the Redpanda deployment.

. Stop the deprecated Redpanda Operator from reconciling the Cluster and Console custom resources:
+
```bash
kubectl --namespace <namespace> annotate cluster <cluster-name> redpanda.vectorized.io/managed="false"
kubectl --namespace <namespace> annotate console <console-name> redpanda.vectorized.io/managed="false"
```

. Delete your Cluster resource's existing StatefulSet:
+
```bash
kubectl --namespace <namespace> delete statefulset <cluster-name> --cascade=orphan
```

. Update the label selectors of all Pods that were in the deleted StatefulSet:

.. To get the Pod names:
+
```bash
kubectl get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=<cluster-name> --namespace <namespace>
```

.. To update the label selectors, do the following for each Pod:
+
```bash
kubectl --namespace <namespace> label pod <pod-name> app.kubernetes.io/component=redpanda-statefulset --overwrite
```

. Adopt your existing Services.
+
--
.. Label and annotate the Services:
+
```bash
kubectl --namespace <namespace> annotate service <cluster-name> meta.helm.sh/release-name=<cluster-name> --overwrite
kubectl --namespace <namespace> annotate service <cluster-name> meta.helm.sh/release-namespace=<namespace> --overwrite
kubectl --namespace <namespace> label service <cluster-name> app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm --overwrite
kubectl --namespace <namespace> annotate service <cluster-name>-external meta.helm.sh/release-name=<cluster-name> --overwrite
kubectl --namespace <namespace> annotate service <cluster-name>-external meta.helm.sh/release-namespace=<namespace> --overwrite
kubectl --namespace <namespace> label service <cluster-name>-external app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm --overwrite
```

.. Update the selectors of the `<cluster-name>` Service:
+
```bash
kubectl --namespace <namespace> edit service <cluster-name>
```
+
Change the selector to:
+
```yaml
selector:
  app.kubernetes.io/instance: <cluster-name>
  app.kubernetes.io/name: redpanda
```
--
+
This step prevents Services from being redeployed, which reduces downtime. Because the names of these Services match the names of the Services that the Redpanda Helm chart will try to deploy, these annotations and labels bring the existing Services under the management of Helm so that they do not get deleted and redeployed when you apply the Redpanda resource.

. Adopt the ServiceAccount:
+
```bash
kubectl --namespace <namespace> annotate serviceaccount <cluster-name> meta.helm.sh/release-name=<cluster-name>
kubectl --namespace <namespace> annotate serviceaccount <cluster-name> meta.helm.sh/release-namespace=<namespace>
kubectl --namespace <namespace> label serviceaccount <cluster-name> app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm --overwrite
```

. Delete the PodDisruptionBudget:
+
```bash
kubectl --namespace <namespace> delete PodDisruptionBudget <cluster-name>
```

== Migrate Cluster and Console resources to Redpanda resources

You can now convert your deprecated Cluster and Console resources to a Redpanda resource.

. Create a Redpanda resource:
+
.`redpanda-cluster.yaml`
[source,yaml,lines=6-18]
----
apiVersion: cluster.redpanda.com/v1alpha1
kind: Redpanda
metadata:
  name: <cluster-name>
  namespace: <namespace>
  annotations:
    cluster.redpanda.com/managed: "true"
spec:
  migration:
    enabled: true
    clusterRef:
      name: <cluster-name>
      namespace: <namespace>
    consoleRef:
      name: <console-name>
      namespace: <namespace>
----
+
With this configuration, the updated Redpanda Operator will try to migrate your Cluster and/or Console resources to the new Redpanda resource.
+
[NOTE]
====
- The Redpanda Operator does not migrate all configurations. For example, if your cluster had SASL enabled, you must manually add any SASL configuration to the Redpanda resource. For help with configuration, see the xref:reference:k-crd.adoc[Redpanda CRD reference].
- If the `additionalConfiguration` section of your Cluster resource includes `redpanda.empty_seed_starts_cluster: true`, make sure that this configuration is not present in the migrated `redpanda.yaml` file. The Redpanda Helm chart includes this configuration by default, so if your Redpanda resource also includes it, Redpanda will throw an error due to the duplicated configuration.
- Make sure that `resources.memory.container.min` and `resources.memory.container.max` are both set to at least 2.5Gi. Otherwise, Redpanda will be unable to start.
====

. Deploy the Redpanda resource:
+
```bash
kubectl apply -f redpanda-cluster.yaml --namespace <namespace>
```
+
The updated Redpanda Operator will delete the Pods sequentially causing them to be redeployed using Helm and your Redpanda resource.

. Wait for the Redpanda resource to successfully reach a `deployed` state:
+
```bash
kubectl get redpanda <cluster-name> --namespace <namespace> --watch
```
+
Example output:
+
[.no-copy]
----
NAME       READY   STATUS
redpanda   True    Redpanda reconciliation succeeded
----

== Troubleshooting

While the deployment process can sometimes take a few minutes, a prolonged 'not ready' status may indicate an issue.

include::manage:kubernetes/troubleshooting/k-troubleshoot.adoc[tags=deployment]

=== Resources aren't being updated

If you are deleting, annotating, or labeling resources and they appear unchanged, the Redpanda Operator may still be managing your Cluster or Console resource.

Make sure the following annotation is set on your Cluster and Console resources:

`redpanda.vectorized.io/managed="false"`

```bash
kubectl describe cluster <cluster-name> --namespace <namespace>
kubectl describe console <cluster-name> --namespace <namespace>
```

=== Open an issue

If you cannot solve the issue or you need assistance during the migration process, https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/new/choose[open a GitHub issue^] in the Redpanda repository. Before opening a new issue, search the existing issues on GitHub to see if someone has already reported a similar problem or if any relevant discussions that can help you.

== Rollback to the deprecated Redpanda Operator

If you still have the Cluster resource you may undo and revert your changes, but there may be downtime depending on how far you have moved into the migration process.

. Delete the Redpanda resource:
+
```bash
kubectl delete redpanda <cluster-name> --namespace <namespace>
```
+
This step triggers a deletion of all resources created by the HelmRelease

. Enable the deprecated Redpanda Operator to manage your Cluster and Console resources:
+
```bash
kubectl --namespace <namespace> annotate cluster <cluster-name> redpanda.vectorized.io/managed=”true”
kubectl --namespace <namespace> annotate console <console-name> redpanda.vectorized.io/managed=”true”
```

The deprecated Redpanda Operator is now managing your resources. Any changes that the Redpanda Operator made to your deployment will be undone and any resources that you deleted will be reapplied.
