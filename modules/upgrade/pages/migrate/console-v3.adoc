= Migrate to Redpanda Console v3.0.0

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for migrating from Redpanda Console v2.x.x (v2) to v3.x.x (v3). The new release introduces a unified authentication and authorization system along with several breaking changes. Follow the steps below to update your configuration and ensure a smooth transition.

For details on the new authentication and authorization system, see xref:console:config/security/authentication.adoc[].

== Breaking Changes

The following changes require your attention when migrating from v2 to v3:

* The plain login provider is no longer supported. Use a Redpanda SASL/SCRAM user instead.
* Group-based authorization with OIDC is no longer supported.
* The `login` stanza has been renamed to `authentication`.
* The `login.jwtSecret` field has been renamed to `authentication.jwtSigningSecret`.
* The `schemaRegistry` stanza has been removed from the `kafka` stanza. Configure the Schema Registry using the new top-level `schemaRegistry` stanza.
* Role bindings are no longer configured in a separate file. Use the `authorization.roleBindings` stanza in your main configuration file.

== Login providers

In v2, login provider configurations were defined under the `login` stanza. In v3, these have been replaced by the new `authentication` stanza. Below are examples showing how to migrate from different login providers.

=== Migrate from the plain login provider

In v3, the plain login provider is no longer supported and the `enterprise` stanza is deprecated, so you should configure authentication and RBAC directly in the main configuration. For user impersonation, the logged-in user's credentials are re-used when making API calls.

NOTE: Make sure your users are provisioned as SASL/SCRAM users in Redpanda. Use this user to authenticate with Redpanda Console.

.V2 plain login with RBAC
[source,yaml]
----
login:
  enabled: true
  jwtSecret: "secret-key"
  useSecureCookies: false
  plain:
    enabled: true
    credentials:
      - username: "jane"
        password: "some-other-secret-password"
      - username: "john"
        password: "some-secret-password"
enterprise:
  rbac:
    enabled: true
    roleBindingsFilepath: /tmp/role-bindings.yml
----

.V3 user impersonation
[source,yaml]
----
kafka:
  sasl:
    enabled: true
    impersonateUser: true <1>
authentication:  <2>
  jwtSigningSecret: "secret-key"
  useSecureCookies: false
  basic:
    enabled: true  <3>
----
--
<1> When using user impersonation, the credentials from the logged-in user are forwarded to the Kafka API. As a result, any static role binding settings are ignored for impersonated API calls.
<2> The `authentication` stanza replaces the `login` stanza in v3. Use this stanza to configure authentication settings.
<3> The `basic` block enables basic authentication for Redpanda Console.

Role bindings are ignored with user impersonation. If you prefer to disable user impersonation so that static credentials are used instead, modify your configuration as follows:

.V3 static credentials
[source,yaml]
----
kafka:
  sasl:
    enabled: true
    impersonateUser: false <1>
    username: "jane" <2>
    password: "some-other-secret-password"
    mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-256
authentication:
  jwtSigningSecret: "secret-key"
  useSecureCookies: false
  basic:
    enabled: true
# With static credentials, the role bindings still apply to control Console access.
authorization: <3>
  roleBindings:
    - roleName: admin
      users:
        - loginType: basic
          name: "jane"
----

<1> Set `impersonateUser` to `false` to disable user impersonation.
<2> Specify the username, password, and mechanism for the static credentials.
<3> Role bindings are applied when using static credentials.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When impersonation is disabled, the static credentials specified in the `kafka.sasl` block are used to authenticate with Kafka. Ensure that these credentials have the necessary ACLs in Redpanda.

=== Migrate from Google OIDC

In v3, the Google OIDC configuration has been simplified and the `login` stanza has been replaced by the `authentication` stanza. Below is an example showing how to migrate from Google OIDC in v2 to v3.

NOTE: Make sure your users are provisioned as OIDC-OAUTHPROVIDER users in Redpanda. Use this user to authenticate with Redpanda Console.

.V2 Keycloak OIDC
[source,yaml]
----
login:

  jwtSecret: "old-keycloak-secret"
  keycloak:

[IMPORTANT]
====
The directory configuration for group sync with Keycloak is deprecated in v3.
====

== Reconfigure Schema Registry settings

In v2, the Schema Registry configuration was nested under the `kafka` stanza. In v3, this configuration is now a top-level stanza.

[.side-by-side]
--
.V2 Schema Registry
[source,yaml]
----
kafka:
  schemaRegistry:
    enabled: true
    urls:
      - "http://schema-registry.mycompany.com:8081"
----

.V3 Schema Registry
[source,yaml]
----
schemaRegistry:
  enabled: true
  urls:
    - "http://schema-registry.mycompany.com:8081"
----
--

== Integrate role bindings

In v2, role bindings could be configured in a separate file or within the `enterprise` stanza. In v3, the `enterprise` stanza is deprecated, and role bindings must now be configured directly in your main configuration under the `authorization.roleBindings` stanza.

[.side-by-side]
--
.V2 role bindings
[source,yaml]
----
enterprise:
  rbac:
    enabled: true
    roleBindingsFilepath: "/path/to/roleBindings.yaml"
# v2: Role bindings configured in a separate file.
roleBindings:
  - roleName: admin
    metadata:
      name: Developers
      creator: John Doe
    subjects:
      - kind: user
        provider: Plain
        name: alice
----

.V3 role bindings
[source,yaml]
----
authorization:
  roleBindings:
    - roleName: admin
      users:
        - loginType: basic
          name: alice
----
--

== Validate migration

After updating your configuration, verify that:

- Users can log in using the new authentication settings.
- API calls to Kafka, Schema Registry, and the Admin API are authenticated correctly.
