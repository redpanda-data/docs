|===
| Feature | Deprecated in | Details

| `space_management_enable_override`
| 23.3.2
| This property was a workaround in older version of Redpanda. It is no longer required and the property is ignored.

| xref:reference:cluster-properties.adoc#delete_retention_ms[`delete_retention_ms`]
| 23.3.1
| Use xref:reference:cluster-properties.adoc#log_retention_ms[`log_retention_ms`] instead.

| xref:reference:tunable-properties.adoc#partition_autobalancing_movement_batch_size_bytes[`partition_autobalancing_movement_batch_size_bytes`]
| 23.2.12
| Use xref:reference:tunable-properties.adoc#partition_autobalancing_concurrent_moves[`partition_autobalancing_concurrent_moves`] instead.

| xref:23.2@reference:redpanda-operator/index.adoc[Cluster and Console custom resources]
| 23.2.1
| Use the xref:23.2@upgrade:deprecated/cluster-resource.adoc[Redpanda resource] instead.

| xref:reference:tunable-properties.adoc#health_monitor_tick_interval[`health_monitor_tick_interval`]
| 22.2.1
| No longer required. Previously, health refreshes were triggered based on this interval, potentially leading to scenarios where stale health metadata was accessed after a leadership change. The revised mechanism triggers a health refresh only when the controller leader's health metadata becomes stale. Now, whenever a health report is requested, Redpanda checks the age of the metadata. If stale, a refresh request is dispatched to contact the leader directly or to gather fresh information from the cluster. This change ensures that health metadata remains accurate, eliminating unnecessary periodic checks.

| `rpk cluster storage recovery` 
| 23.3.1 
| Use xref:reference:rpk/rpk-cluster/rpk-cluster-storage-restore.adoc[`rpk cluster storage restore`] instead. You can still use `rpk cluster storage recovery` as an alias. 

| `rpk cluster partitions movement` 
| 23.2.1 
| Use xref:reference:rpk/rpk-cluster/rpk-cluster-partitions-move.adoc[`rpk cluster partitions move`] instead. This also applies to `rpk cluster partitions movement status` and `rpk cluster partitions movement cancel`.

| `rpk cluster partitions movement cancel` 
| 23.2.1 
| Use xref:reference:rpk/rpk-cluster/rpk-cluster-partitions-move-cancel.adoc[`rpk cluster partitions move-cancel`] instead.

| `rpk cluster partitions movement status` 
| 23.2.1 
| Use xref:reference:rpk/rpk-cluster/rpk-cluster-partitions-move-status.adoc[`rpk cluster partitions move-status`] instead.

| `rpk cloud auth create` 
| 23.3.9 
| This command has been fully deprecated. `rpk cloud auth` fully manages authentication fields now.
