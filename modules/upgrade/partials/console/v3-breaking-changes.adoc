- Authentication changes:

** No more support for the plain login provider. Use a Redpanda SASL/SCRAM user instead.
** No more support for group-based authorization with OIDC.
** The `login` stanza in the configuration file has been renamed to `authentication`.
** The `login.jwtSecret` field in the configuration file has been renamed to `authentication.jwtSigningSecret` to reflect its purpose more accurately.

- Schema Registry and API changes:

** The `schemaRegistry` stanza has been removed from the `kafka` stanza. Use the top-level `schemaRegistry` stanza instead.
** Role bindings are no longer configured in a separate file. Use the `authorization.roleBindings` stanza instead.

- Serde and connect changes:

**  `kafka.protobuf`, `kafka.cbor`, and `kafka.messagePack` are now all under a top-level `serde` stanza.
** `connect` has been renamed to `kafkaConnect` to avoid ambiguity with Redpanda Connect.
** `console.maxDeserializationPayloadSize` has been moved into the new `serde` stanza.
