- Authentication and authorization changes:

** The plain login provider has been removed. Use a Redpanda SASL/SCRAM user with user impersonation instead.
** You can no longer use group-based authorization with OIDC.
+
Authorization is now handled directly by Redpanda using RBAC. Roles have become the primary primitive for access management, allowing you to define granular permissions for actions such as managing topics, clusters, and more within Redpanda Console.
** The `login` stanza in the configuration file has been renamed to `authentication`.
** The `login.jwtSecret` field in the configuration file has been renamed to `authentication.jwtSigningSecret` to reflect its purpose more accurately.
** Role bindings are no longer configured in a separate file. Use the `authorization.roleBindings` stanza instead.

- Other changes:

** The `schemaRegistry` stanza has been removed from the `kafka` stanza. Use the top-level `schemaRegistry` stanza instead.
**  `kafka.protobuf`, `kafka.cbor`, and `kafka.messagePack` are now all under a top-level `serde` stanza.
** `kafka.protobuf.schemaRegistry` has been deprecated. Use the top-level `schemaRegistry` stanza instead.
** `connect` has been renamed to `kafkaConnect` to avoid ambiguity with Redpanda Connect.
** `console.maxDeserializationPayloadSize` has been moved into the new `serde` stanza.
