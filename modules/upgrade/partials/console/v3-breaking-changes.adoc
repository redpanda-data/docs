- Authentication and authorization changes:

** The plain login provider has been removed. Use a Redpanda SASL/SCRAM user with user impersonation instead.
** You can no longer use group-based authorization with OIDC.
+
Previously, Redpanda Console supported OIDC groups. However, with the unified authentication model, RBAC is now handled directly by Redpanda, which does not support OIDC groups. As a result, OIDC-based group authorization is no longer available in Redpanda Console.
** The `login` stanza in the configuration file has been renamed to `authentication`.
** The `login.jwtSecret` field in the configuration file has been renamed to `authentication.jwtSigningSecret` to reflect its purpose more accurately.
** Role bindings are no longer configured in a separate file. Use the `authorization.roleBindings` stanza instead.

- Other changes:

** The `schemaRegistry` stanza has been removed from the `kafka` stanza. Use the top-level `schemaRegistry` stanza instead.
**  `kafka.protobuf`, `kafka.cbor`, and `kafka.messagePack` are now all under a top-level `serde` stanza.
** `kafka.protobuf.schemaRegistry` has been deprecated. Use the top-level `schemaRegistry` stanza instead.
** `connect` has been renamed to `kafkaConnect` to avoid ambiguity with Redpanda Connect.
** `console.maxDeserializationPayloadSize` has been moved into the new `serde` stanza.
