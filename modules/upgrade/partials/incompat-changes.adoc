=== Review incompatible changes

* Starting in version 24.2, when managing configuration properties using the AlterConfigs API directly, or the `kafka-configs.sh` shell script without incremental flags, Redpanda resets all unspecified values to the default values. This aligns more closely with the behavior in Apache Kafka. There is no change if you're managing your configuration with tools like `rpk`, Redpanda Console, Kubernetes, Helm, or Terraform.

NOTE: An exception is made for the `redpanda.remote.` topic properties, such as `redpanda.remote.delete`. The remote properties are intentionally sticky to avoid the possibility of disabling Tiered Storage.

* Starting in version 24.2, xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/manage-throughput.adoc#client-throughput-limits[client throughput limits] are compatible with the https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-546%3A+Add+Client+Quota+APIs+to+the+Admin+Client[AlterClientQuotas and DescribeClientQuotas^] Kafka APIs. Redpanda determines client throughput limits on a per-broker basis. In earlier versions, client throughput quotas were applied from cluster configurations on a per-shard basis. 

* Patch releases in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/discussions/9522[22.3.14^] and https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/discussions/9523[23.1.2^] changed the behavior when remote read is disabled and the requested Raft term falls below the local log's beginning. In earlier versions, Redpanda returned an offset -1. With the patch, when you request a value older than the lowest offset, Redpanda returns the lowest offset, not -1.
