=== Review incompatible changes

* Starting in version 24.2, when managing configuration properties using the AlterConfigs API directly, or the `kafka-configs.sh` shell script without incremental flags, Redpanda resets all unspecified values to the default values. This aligns more closely with the behavior in Apache Kafka. There is no change if you're managing your configuration with tools like `rpk`, Redpanda Console, Kubernetes, Helm, or Terraform.

NOTE: This does not pertain to the `redpanda.remote.` topic properties, such as `redpanda.remote.delete`. The remote properties are not reset to their defaults by the AlterConfigs API to avoid the possibility of unintentionally disabling Tiered Storage for a topic, which could cause significant operational issues for clusters designed to use Tiered Storage exclusively or with object storage as the only durable storage tier.

* Starting in version 24.2, xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/manage-throughput.adoc#client-throughput-limits[client throughput limits] are compatible with the https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-546%3A+Add+Client+Quota+APIs+to+the+Admin+Client[AlterClientQuotas and DescribeClientQuotas^] Kafka APIs. Redpanda determines client throughput limits on a per-broker basis. In earlier versions, client throughput quotas were applied from cluster configurations on a per-shard basis.

* Starting in version 24.2, xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#transaction_max_timeout_ms[transaction_max_timeout_ms] defaults to 15 minutes, which limits the timeout a transactional producer can set during initialization. When performing upgrades to version 24.2, if you have clients with timeouts larger than `transaction_max_timeout_ms`, then new producer initialization requests will fail due to this limit enforcement. Either reduce the client set transaction timeout to less than 15 minutes or increase the default `transaction_max_timeout_ms` on the service side.

* Patch releases in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/discussions/9522[22.3.14^] and https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/discussions/9523[23.1.2^] changed the behavior when remote read is disabled and the requested Raft term falls below the local log's beginning. In earlier versions, Redpanda returned an offset -1. With the patch, when you request a value older than the lowest offset, Redpanda returns the lowest offset, not -1.
