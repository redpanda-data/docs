Docker::

CAUTION: Running Redpanda directly on Docker is not supported for production usage. This platform should only be used for testing.

To perform an upgrade you must replace the current image with a new one.

First, check which image is currently running in Docker:

```bash
docker ps
```

Stop and remove the containers:

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
docker rm <container_id>
```

Remove current images:

```bash
docker rmi <image_id>
```

Pull the desired Redpanda version, or adjust the setting to `latest` in the `version` tag:

```bash
docker pull docker.redpanda.com/redpandadata/redpanda:<version>
```

After it completes, restart the cluster:

```bash
docker restart <container_name>
```

For more information, see the xref:get-started:quick-start.adoc[Redpanda Quickstart].

macOS::

If you previously installed Redpanda with brew, run:

```bash
brew upgrade redpanda-data/tap/redpanda
```

For installations from binary files, download the preferred version from the release list and then overwrite the current rpk file in the installed location.
