| Metric Name | Description |Recommendations

| xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc#redpanda_kafka_under_replicated_replicas[redpanda_kafka_under_replicated_replicas]
| Measures the number of under-replicated Kafka replicas. Non-zero: Replication lagging. Zero: All replicas replicated.
| Pause upgrades if non-zero.

| xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc#redpanda_cluster_unavailable_partitions[redpanda_cluster_unavailable_partitions]
| Represents the number of partitions that are currently unavailable. Value of zero indicates all partitions are available. Non-zero indicates the respective count of unavailable partitions.
| Ensure metric shows zero unavailable partitions before restart.

| xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc#redpanda_kafka_request_bytes_total[redpanda_kafka_request_bytes_total]
| Total bytes processed for Kafka requests.
| Ensure produce and consume rate for each broker recovers to its pre-upgrade value before restart.

| xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc#redpanda_kafka_request_latency_seconds[redpanda_kafka_request_latency_seconds]
| Latency for processing Kafka requests. Indicates the delay between a Kafka request being initiated and completed.
| Ensure the p99 histogram value recovers to its pre-upgrade level before restart.

| xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc#redpanda_rpc_request_latency_seconds[redpanda_rpc_request_latency_seconds]
| Latency for processing RPC requests. Shows the delay between an RPC request initiation and completion.
| Ensure the p99 histogram value returns to its pre-upgrade level before restart.

| xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc#redpanda_cpu_busy_seconds_total[redpanda_cpu_busy_seconds_total]
| CPU utilization for a given second. The value is a decimal between 0.0 and 1.0. A value of 1.0 means that the CPU was busy for the entire second, operating at 100% capacity. A value of 0.5 implies the CPU was busy for half the time (or 500 milliseconds) in the given second. A value of 0.0 indicates that the CPU was idle and not busy during the entire second.
|If you're seeing high values consistently, investigate the reasons. It could be due to high traffic or other system bottlenecks.
