ifdef::rolling-upgrade[]
A rolling upgrade involves putting a broker into xref:manage:node-management.adoc[maintenance mode], upgrading the broker, taking the broker out of maintenance mode, and then repeating the process on the next broker in the cluster. Placing brokers into maintenance mode ensures a smooth upgrade of your cluster while reducing the risk of interruption or degradation in service.

When a broker is placed into maintenance mode, it reassigns its partition leadership to other brokers for all topics that have a replication factor greater than one. Reassigning partition leadership involves _draining_ leadership from the broker and _transferring_ that leadership to another broker.

. Check for topics that have a replication factor greater than one.
+
If you have topics with `replication.factor=1`, and if you have sufficient disk space, Redpanda Data recommends temporarily increasing the replication factor. This can help limit outages for these topics during the rolling upgrade. Do this before the upgrade to make sure there's time for the data to replicate to other brokers. For more information, see xref:manage:data-migration.adoc#change-topic-replication-factor[Change topic replication factor].

. Ensure that all brokers are active before upgrading:
+
[,bash]
----
rpk redpanda admin brokers list
----
+
All brokers should show `active` for `MEMBERSHIP` and `true` for `IS-ALIVE`:

New features in a version are enabled after all brokers in the cluster are upgraded. If problems occur, the upgrade is not committed.

ifdef::rolling-restart[]
A rolling restart involves putting a broker into and out of xref:manage:node-management.adoc[maintenance mode], and then repeating the process on the next broker in the cluster. Placing brokers into maintenance mode ensures a smooth restart of your cluster while reducing the risk of interruption or degradation in service.
