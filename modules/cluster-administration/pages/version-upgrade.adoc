= Version Upgrade
:description: Version upgrade procedures.
:pp: {plus}{plus}

As part of Redpanda's evolution, new versions are released over time to deliver new features, enhancements, and improvements.
Due to that, it's essential to keep Redpanda up to date. This guide details how to upgrade versions relevant to the environment that Redpanda is currently running in.

NOTE: Before upgrading to alternate versions, refer to the https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases[release notes] to learn about any breaking changes.

== Checking the current version

Before changing to a different version, you will first need to determine which version is currently running in your environment.
To determine the current version, run the following commands:

[tabs]
=====
Linux::
+
--
[,bash]
----
curl -s -XGET http://<broker host>:9644/v1/brokers/
----

NOTE: The command returns all broker information at once. Remember to replace the variable `<broker host>`.

--
MacOS::
+
--
[,bash]
----
brew list --versions | grep redpanda
----

--
Kubernetes::
+
--
[,bash]
----
kubectl exec -it -n <cluster_name> <pod-name> -- rpk version
----

NOTE: Remember to replace the variables `<cluster_name>` and `<pod_name>`.

--
Docker::
+
--
CAUTION: Running Redpanda directly via Docker is not supported for production usage. This platform should only be used for testing.

[,bash]
----
docker exec -it <container_name> rpk version
----

NOTE: Remember to replace the variable `<container_name>`.

--
=====

The expected output looks similar to:

[,bash]
----
v21.11.5 (rev af88fa1)
----

== Available versions

You can check which versions are available in the https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases[release notes].

== Upgrading your version

NOTE: When upgrading between major versions, Redpanda only supports upgrading one version at a time. For example, upgrading from `22.1` to `22.2` is supported, while upgrading from `22.1` directly to `22.3` is not. In the latter case, you would upgrade first to `22.2`, and then to `22.3`.


[tabs]
======
Linux::
+
--
For Linux distributions, the process changes according to the distribution:

[tabs]
====
Fedora/RedHat::
+
Execute the following commands on the terminal:
+
```bash
sudo yum update redpanda
```
Debian/Ubuntu::
+
Execute the following commands on the terminal:
+
[,bash]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt install redpanda
----
====
--
MacOS::
+
--
If you have previously installed Redpanda with brew, you can run the following command:

```bash
brew install vectorizedio/tap/redpanda
```

Installations from binary files require you to download the preferred version from the release list and then to overwrite the current rpk file in the installed location.
--
Kubernetes::
+
--
CAUTION: To prevent any potential data loss when Kubernetes is locally executed, you must use persistent volumes.

All applications running in Kubernetes require deployment files to execute, including Redpanda. To upgrade to the latest version, change the `version` tag in your deployment file:
```yaml
...
spec:
  image: "vectorized/redpanda"
  version: "<current_version>"
...
```

After saving the file, you will need to apply the changes with the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f <file_path/file_name>
```

Once the changes are applied, the cluster will perform a rolling upgrade, restarting one pod at a time. During the upgrade, the status field `upgrading` is _true_. You will be able to see the status of the cluster by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl describe cluster <cluster_name>
```

The `upgrading` status will show as _false_ once the upgrade is complete. To validate the individual pod details, and the image tag (version), use the following command:

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
```
--
Docker::
+
--
CAUTION: Running Redpanda directly via Docker is not supported for production usage. This platform should only be used for testing.

To perform an upgrade you must replace the current image with a new one. First, check which image is currently running on your Docker:

```bash
docker ps
```

CAUTION: To prevent any potential data loss when Docker is locally executed, you must use persistent volumes. For more information, refer to xref:quickstart:quick-start-docker.adoc#create-network-and-persistent-volumes[persistent volumes].

Stop and remove Redpanda's container(s):

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
...
docker rm <container_id>
```

Remove current images:

```bash
docker rmi <image_id>
```

Pull the desired Redpanda's version, or adjust the setting to `latest` in the `version` tag:

```bash
docker pull docker.redpanda.com/redpandadata/redpanda: <version>
```

If you have any questions about how to start Redpanda on Docker, refer to xref:quickstart:quick-start-docker.adoc[docker getting started].

Once completed, restart the cluster:

```bash
docker restart <container_name>
```

== Post-upgrade applications

Now, you will have the desired version of Redpanda running.

Once the upgrade is complete, you will need to ensure that the cluster is healthy. To verify that the cluster is running properly, run the following command:

```bash
rpk cluster health
```

If you want to view additional information about your brokers, run:

```bash
rpk redpanda admin brokers list
```

You'll also want to set up a real-time dashboard to monitor your cluster health. That can be done by following the steps in our xref:cluster-administration:monitoring.adoc[monitoring guide].

If you would like to perform a rolling upgrade on your cluster using maintenance mode, refer to xref:cluster-administration:node-management.adoc[Node Maintenance Mode]. Keep in mind that rolling upgrades are only available in versions **22.1 and later**.
