= Recommended Cloud Instance Types
:description: Find the recommended cloud instance types that support local NVMe disks on Kubernetes managed services: Amazon EKS, Azure EKS, and Google GKE.

{description}

Redpanda Data recommends using locally attached NVMe devices with an XFS filesystem for the Redpanda data directory. NVMe devices offer high I/O operations per second (IOPS) and minimal latency, while XFS offers enhanced performance with Redpanda workloads.

NOTE: For all recommended instance types, choose a model that meets the xref:./kubernetes-cluster-requirements.adoc[requirements and recommendations], depending on the size of your Redpanda cluster and your expected workload.

== Amazon EKS

*Default filesystem*: EKS defaults to the ext4 filesystem. Use XFS instead where possible.

*Recommended instance types*:

- General purpose: General-purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources, and they can be used for a variety of diverse workloads.

** https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m5/[M5d^]
** https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m5/[M5ad^]
** https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m5/[M5dn^]
** https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m6g/[M6gd^]
** https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m7g/[M7gd^]

- Memory optimized: Memory-optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.

** https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/r6g/[R6gd^]

** https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/x2/[X2gd^]
** https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/x2i/[X2idn^]
** https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/x2i/[X2iedn^]
** https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/z1d/[z1d^]

- Storage optimized: Storage-optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage. They are optimized to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, random IOPS to applications.

** https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/i3/[I3^]
** https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/i3en/[I3en^]

- Compute optimized: Compute-optimized instances deliver cost-effective high performance at a low price per compute ratio for running advanced compute-intensive workloads.

** https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c5/[C5ad^]

== Azure AKS

*Filesystem*: AKS often defaults to the ext4 filesystem. Use XFS instead where possible.

*Recommended machine types*:

- Memory optimized: Memory-optimized VM sizes offer a high memory-to-CPU ratio.

** https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ebdsv5-ebsv5-series[Ebdsv5 series (NVMe)^]

- Storage optimized: Storage-optimized virtual machine (VM) sizes offer high disk throughput and IO.

** https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/lsv2-series[Lsv2 series^]
** https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/lsv3-series[Lsv3 series^]
** https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/lasv3-series[Lasv3 series^]

== Google GKE

*Filesystem*: GKE often defaults to the ext4 filesystem. Use XFS instead where possible.

*Recommended machine types*:

- General purpose: The general-purpose machine family has the best price-performance with the most flexible vCPU to memory ratios, and provides features that target most standard and cloud-native workloads.

** https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines#c3-with-local-ssd[C3 machine series with local SSD^]
** https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines#n2_series[N2 machine series^]
** https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines#n2d_machines[N2D machine series^]

- Memory optimized: The memory-optimized machine family provides the most compute and memory resources of any Compute Engine machine family offering. They are ideal for workloads that require higher memory-to-vCPU ratios than the high-memory machine types in the general-purpose N1 machine series.

** https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/memory-optimized-machines#m3_series[M3 machine series^]

- Compute optimized: Compute-optimized VM instances are ideal for compute-intensive and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.

** https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/compute-optimized-machines#c2d_series[C2D machine series^]
** https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/compute-optimized-machines#c2_machine_types[C2 machine series^]
