= Recommended Cloud Instance Types for Local NVMe SSD
:description: Find the recommended cloud instance types that support local NVMe disks on Kubernetes managed services: Amazon EKS, Azure EKS, and Google GKE.

{description}

Redpanda Data recommends using locally attached NVMe devices with an XFS filesystem for the Redpanda data directory. NVMe devices offer high IOPS and minimal latency, while XFS offers enhanced performance with Redpanda workloads. For more details about cluster requirements and recommendations, see xref:./kubernetes-cluster-requirements.adoc[]

== Amazon EKS

*Default filesystem*: EKS defaults to the ext4 filesystem. Use XFS instead where possible.

*Recommended instance types*:

- General purpose: General-purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory and networking resources, and can be used for a variety of diverse workloads. These instances are ideal for applications that use these resources in equal proportions such as web servers and code repositories.

** https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m6g/[M6gd^]
** https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m7g/[M7gd^]

- Memory optimized: Memory-optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.

** https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/x2i/[X2iedn^]
** https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/z1d/[z1d^]

- Storage optimized: Storage-optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage. They are optimized to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, random I/O operations per second (IOPS) to applications.

== Azure AKS

*Filesystem*: AKS often defaults to the ext4 filesystem. Use XFS instead where possible.

*Recommended instance types*:

- Memory optimized: Memory-optimized VM sizes offer a high memory-to-CPU ratio.

** https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ebdsv5-ebsv5-series[Ebdsv5 series (NVMe)^]

- Storage optimized: Storage-optimized virtual machine (VM) sizes offer high disk throughput and IO.

** https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/lsv2-series[Lsv2 series^]
** https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/lsv3-series[Lsv3 series^]
** https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/lasv3-series[Lasv3 series^]

== Google GKE

*Filesystem*: GKE often defaults to the ext4 filesystem. Use XFS instead where possible.

*Recommended instance types*:

- General purpose: The general-purpose machine family has the best price-performance with the most flexible vCPU to memory ratios, and provides features that target most standard and cloud-native workloads.

** https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines#n2d_machines[N2D machine series^]

- Memory optimized: The memory-optimized machine family provides the most compute and memory resources of any Compute Engine machine family offering. They are ideal for workloads that require higher memory-to-vCPU ratios than the high-memory machine types in the general-purpose N1 machine series.

** https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/memory-optimized-machines#m3_series[M3 machine series^]

- Compute optimized: Compute-optimized virtual machine (VMs) instances are ideal for compute-intensive and high performance computing (HPC) workloads.
