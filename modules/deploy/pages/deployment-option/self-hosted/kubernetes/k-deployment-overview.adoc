Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool that helps you manage Redpanda deployments using declarative configuration files called _manifests_. Kubernetes provides a standardized way of achieving the following:

* High availability
* Disaster recovery
* Scalability

== Deployment tools

To deploy Redpanda in Kubernetes, you can choose to use Helm for its simplicity or the Redpanda Operator to leverage custom resource definitions (CRDs) for a more GitOps-friendly deployment process. The Redpanda Operator is the recommended option for production deployments.

|===
| Feature | Helm | Redpanda Operator

| *Version management*
| Supported through Helm, enabling updates and rollbacks.
| Managed through Redpanda custom resources, with optional integration with Flux for GitOps workflows.

| *Multi-tenant Kubernetes clusters*
| Supported. Helm allows deployment of multiple independent Redpanda clusters by defining different Helm release names.
| Supported. The Redpanda Operator provides a declarative approach for managing multi-tenant clusters using the RedpandaList custom resource.

| *Dependency and configuration management*
| Managed through the Redpanda Helm chart.
| Configurations are defined in custom resources.
|===

TIP: If you are already using the Redpanda Helm chart and want to migrate to the latest Redpanda Operator for better lifecycle management, see xref:upgrade:migrate/kubernetes/helm-to-operator.adoc[Migrate from the Redpanda Helm chart].

=== Helm

https://helm.sh/docs[Helm^] is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies defining, installing, and upgrading Kubernetes applications. Helm uses charts, a collection of files describing Kubernetes resources, to deploy applications in a Kubernetes cluster.

The Redpanda Helm chart provides all the manifest files required to deploy Redpanda in Kubernetes, including:

- A StatefulSet to manage Redpanda brokers
- A Headless ClusterIP Service for internal communication with the Redpanda cluster
- A NodePort Service for external communication with the Redpanda cluster

=== Redpanda Operator

The Redpanda Operator provides two deployment modes controlled by the `useFlux` flag. The modes differ in how reconciliation is handled.

IMPORTANT: The `useFlux: false` configuration is in beta. It is not supported for production deployments. Beta features are available for users to test and https://redpandacommunity.slack.com/[provide feedback^].

- *Flux-managed mode (`useFlux: true`)*:
When `useFlux` is set to `true` (default), the Redpanda Operator delegates reconciliation to https://fluxcd.io/flux/concepts/[Flux^] controllers. The workflow is as follows:
+
. The Redpanda Operator defines the necessary CRDs for Redpanda. A Redpanda resource represents a Redpanda cluster, configured through the Redpanda Helm chart values.
. When the Redpanda Operator detects changes to Redpanda resources, it triggers Flux to reconcile the corresponding HelmRelease resource.
. Flux uses the HelmRelease resource to manage the lifecycle of the Redpanda Helm chart, applying updates as needed.

- *Redpanda-managed mode (`useFlux: false`)*:
When `useFlux` is set to `false`, the Redpanda Operator manages and reconciles Redpanda resources directly, without involving Flux. This mode works as follows:
+
. The Redpanda Operator creates both `HelmRelease` and `HelmRepository` resources but suspends them, keeping Flux inactive.
+
NOTE: Although these resources are created in a suspended state, the operator still requires the Flux CRDs to be installed.
. The operator directly reconciles Redpanda resources, performing tasks such as installations, updates, and cleanup, normally handled by Flux.
. If `useFlux` is later re-enabled, the operator unsuspends the Flux resources, and Flux resumes lifecycle management.

Example configuration to specify the deployment mode in Redpanda's custom resource:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.redpanda.com/v1alpha2
kind: Redpanda
metadata:
  name: redpanda
spec:
  chartRef:
    useFlux: true  # or false, depending on your desired deployment mode
----

== Kubernetes deployment environments

You can run Redpanda on managed Kubernetes services as well as in bare-metal environments. Managed Kubernetes services offer simpler deployment and maintenance, while bare-metal environments provide complete control and cost efficiencies.

=== Managed Kubernetes

Managed Kubernetes services, such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), handle core components of a Kubernetes cluster, offering benefits such as:

* *Ease of deployment*: Pre-configured instances join your Kubernetes cluster automatically.
* *Control plane maintenance*: The provider maintains the control plane, ensuring security and reliability.
* *Health monitoring and repairs*: The provider monitors master nodes and repairs them as needed.

You remain responsible for deploying and maintaining Redpanda instances on worker nodes.

=== Bare-metal Kubernetes environments

Bare-metal Kubernetes environments give you complete control over both the control plane and the worker nodes, which can be advantageous when you want the following:

* *Complete control*: Bare-metal Kubernetes offers control over every aspect of deployment, suited for highly customized environments.
* *Custom configurations*: You have granular control to fine-tune the Kubernetes setup.
* *Cost efficiency*: Owning and operating your hardware may be more economical over time.

== Documentation conventions

This documentation follows conventions to help users easily identify Kubernetes resource types and Helm values:

* *Resource names*: Kubernetes resource names, such as Service or PersistentVolume, are capitalized and in Pascal case to match the manifest files.
* *Helm values*: Helm values, like `storage.persistentVolume.enabled`, are displayed in monospace font.
