This topic describes how to use the Redpanda Helm chart to configure and deploy Redpanda Connectors in Kubernetes.

Redpanda Connectors is a package that includes glossterm:Kafka Connect['Kafka Connect is a framework that provides a consistent and reliable platform to run and manage connectors.'] and the following built-in glossterm:connectors['Connectors are the plugins that interface with external systems. Connectors are plugged into Kafka Connect to facilitate data flow between Redpanda and these external systems.'], sometimes known as plugins. You can create and configure the built-in connectors in Redpanda Console.

[cols="1a,2a"]
|===
|Built-In Connector|Description

|MirrorSourceConnector
|A glossterm:source connector['A source connector imports data from a source system into a Redpanda cluster. The source could be a cloud storage system such as S3 or GCS. The source connector's main task is to fetch data from these sources and convert them into a format suitable for Redpanda.'] that replicates records between multiple Kafka clusters. It is part of Kafka's MirrorMaker, which provides capabilities for mirroring data across Kafka clusters.

|MirrorCheckpointConnector
|A source connector that ensures the mirroring process can resume from where it left off in case of failures. It tracks and emits checkpoints that mirror the offsets of the source and target clusters.

|MirrorHeartbeatConnector
|A source connector that emits heartbeats to target topics at a regular interval, enabling MirrorMaker to track active topics on the source cluster and to synchronize consumer groups across clusters.

|===

NOTE: If you want to use other connectors, you must create a custom Docker image that includes them as plugins. See <<Install a new connector>>.

== Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster. You must have `kubectl` with at least version {supported-kubernetes-version}.
+
To check if you have `kubectl` installed:
+
```bash
kubectl version --short --client
```

- https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm^] installed with at least version {supported-helm-version}.
+
To check if you have Helm installed:
+
```bash
helm version
```

- For better readability, you need https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/[jq^] to parse JSON results when using the Kafka Connect REST API.

- An understanding of https://kafka.apache.org/20/documentation.html#connect_overview[Kafka Connect].

== Limitations

- *No TLS or SASL support for the Kafka Connect REST API*: All incoming traffic to Kafka Connect, such as from Redpanda Console, is unauthenticated and sent in plain text. Although Kafka Connect supports TLS for network encryption and SASL for authentication, the Redpanda Connectors subchart does not. Outgoing traffic from Kafka Connect to Redpanda brokers does support TLS and SASL.

- *Pod replicas*: You cannot configure the number of Pod replicas for Redpanda Connectors. Redpanda Data recommends using an autoscaler such as https://keda.sh/[Keda] to increase the number of Pod replicas automatically when certain conditions, such as high CPU or memory usage, are met.

== Deploy the Helm chart

The Redpanda Helm chart includes Redpanda Connectors as a glossterm:subchart['In Helm, a subchart is a child chart that's packaged within a parent chart.'] so that you can deploy a Redpanda cluster, Redpanda Connectors, and Redpanda Console using a single chart. You can enable and configure the Redpanda Connectors subchart in the `connectors` section of the Helm values.

The subchart includes a Pod that runs Kafka Connect and the built-in connectors. The Pod is managed by a Deployment that you can configure in the Helm values under `connectors.deployment`. Redpanda Console connects to Kafka Connect through the default `redpanda-connectors` Service. Kafka Connect connects to the Redpanda brokers through the default `redpanda` Service.

NOTE: Do not schedule Pods that run Kafka Connect on the same nodes as Redpanda brokers. Redpanda brokers require access to all node resources. See <<Tolerations>> and <<Affinity rules>>.

When deploying Redpanda Connectors with Helm, you can choose between two modes:

[cols="1a,2a,2a", options="header"]
|===
|Mode |Description |Recommended For

|<<Automatic mode>>
|
When `connectors.deployment.create` is `false`, the chart automatically configures and creates the Deployment resource with the following:

- The URLs of Redpanda brokers that Kafka Connect should connect to
- TLS settings for Redpanda brokers that have TLS enabled
- SASL authentication settings for Redpanda brokers that have SASL enabled

|A streamlined deployment with the option to modify specific configurations.

|<<Manual mode>>
|
When `connectors.deployment.create` is `true`, you are responsible for configuring all aspects of the Deployment resource using the Helm values.

|Full control over the Deployment resource and its configurations.
|===

=== Automatic mode

In automatic mode, the Redpanda Connectors subchart is automatically configured using the values in the Redpanda Helm chart. You don't need to add any additional configuration. The chart automatically configures the Deployment resource with the values needed for Kafka Connect to communicate with your Redpanda cluster and for Redpanda Console to communicate with Kafka Connect.

NOTE: All incoming traffic to Kafka Connect, such as from Redpanda Console, is unauthenticated (no SASL) and sent in plain text (no TLS). See <<Limitations>>.

. Deploy the Redpanda Helm chart with connectors enabled.
+
Configure any additional Helm values that you want to override in the `clusterSpec` settings. See <<Configuration advice>> for details.

Make sure to configure the following:
+
--
- `connectors.connectors.bootstrapServers`: Kafka API endpoints on the Redpanda brokers for Kafka Connect to connect to.
- `connectors.connectors.brokerTLS` (if `tls.enabled` is `true`): The brokers' TLS settings.
- `connectors.auth.sasl` (if `auth.sasl.enabled` is `true`): The brokers' SASL authentication settings.

== Configuration advice

This section provides advice for configuring the Redpanda Connectors subchart. All settings are nested in the `connectors` property of the Redpanda Helm chart. For all available settings, see xref:reference:connector-helm-spec.adoc[].

=== Name overrides

Deploying multiple instances of the same Helm chart in a Kubernetes cluster can lead to naming conflicts. Using `nameOverride` and `fullnameOverride` helps differentiate between them. If you have a production and staging environment for Redpanda connectors, different names help to avoid confusion.

- Use `nameOverride` to customize:

** The default labels `app.kubernetes.io/component=<nameOverride>` and `app.kubernetes.io/name=<nameOverride>`
** The suffix in the name of the resources `redpanda-<nameOverride>`
- Use `fullnameOverride` to customize the full name of the resources such as the Deployment and Services.

[source,yaml]
----
connectors:
  nameOverride: 'redpanda-connector-production'
  fullnameOverride: 'redpanda-connector-instance-prod'
----

For all available settings, see the xref:reference:connector-helm-spec.adoc#nameoverride[Helm specification].

=== Labels

Kubernetes labels help you to organize, query, and manage your resources. Use labels to categorize Kubernetes resources in different deployments by environment, purpose, or team.

[source,yaml]
----
connectors:
  commonLabels:
    env: 'production'
----

For all available settings, see the xref:reference:connector-helm-spec.adoc#commonlabels[Helm specification].

=== Tolerations

Tolerations and taints allow Pods to be scheduled onto nodes where they otherwise wouldn't. If you have nodes dedicated to Redpanda Connectors with a taint `dedicated=redpanda-connectors:NoSchedule`, the following toleration allows the Pods to be scheduled on them.

[source,yaml]
----
connectors:
  tolerations:
  - key: "dedicated"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "redpanda-connectors"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
----

For all available settings, see the xref:reference:connector-helm-spec.adoc#tolerations[Helm specification].

=== Docker image

You can specify the image tag to deploy a known version of the Docker image. Avoid using the `latest` tag, which can lead to unexpected changes.

If you're using a private repository, always ensure your nodes have the necessary credentials to pull the image.

[source,yaml]
----
connectors:
  image:
    repository: "redpanda/connectors"
    tag: "1.2.3"
----

For all available settings, see the xref:reference:connector-helm-spec.adoc#image[Helm specification].

=== Kafka Connect

You can configure Kafka Connect using the `connectors` settings.

Change the default REST API port only if it conflicts with an existing port.

The `bootstrapServers` setting should point to the Kafka API endpoints on your Redpanda brokers.

NOTE: If you install the chart in automatic mode, `bootstrapServers` is set automatically.

If you want to use Schema Registry, ensure the URL is set to the IP address or domain name of a Redpanda broker and that it includes the Schema Registry port.

[source,yaml]
----
connectors:
  connectors:
    restPort: 8082
    bootstrapServers: "redpanda-broker-0:9092"
    schemaRegistryURL: "http://schema-registry.default.svc.cluster.local:8081"
----

For all available settings, see the xref:reference:connector-helm-spec.adoc#connectors[Helm specification].

=== Authentication

If your Redpanda cluster has SASL enabled, configure SASL authentication for secure communication with your Kafka connectors. If you install the Redpanda Helm chart in automatic mode, SASL authentication is configured automatically.

[source,yaml]
----
connectors:
  auth:
    sasl:
      enabled: true
      mechanism: "SCRAM-SHA-512"
      userName: "admin"
      secretRef: "sasl-password-secret"
----

For all available settings, see the xref:reference:connector-helm-spec.adoc#auth[Helm specification].

=== Container resources

Specify resource requests and limits. Ensure that `javaMaxHeapSize` is not greater than `container.resources.limits.memory`.

[source,yaml]
----
connectors:
  container:
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 1
        memory: 1Gi
      limits:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 2Gi
      javaMaxHeapSize: 2G
    javaGCLogEnabled: false
----

For all available settings, see the xref:reference:connector-helm-spec.adoc#container[Helm specification].

=== Logging

In production, use the `info` logging level to avoid overwhelming the storage. For debugging purposes, temporarily change the logging level to `debug`.

[source,yaml]
----
connectors:
  logging:
    level: "info"
----

For all available settings, see the xref:reference:connector-helm-spec.adoc#logging[Helm specification].

=== Monitoring

If you have the https://prometheus-operator.dev/[Prometheus Operator], enable monitoring to deploy a PodMonitor resource for Kafka Connect. Observability is essential in production environments.

[source,yaml]
----
connectors:
  monitoring:
    enabled: true
----

For all available settings, see the xref:reference:connector-helm-spec.adoc#monitoring[Helm specification].

See also: xref:manage:kubernetes/monitoring/monitor-connectors.adoc[]

=== Deployment strategy

For smooth and uninterrupted updates, use the default `RollingUpdate` strategy. Additionally, set a budget to ensure a certain number of Pod replicas remain available during the update.

[source,yaml]
----
connectors:
  deployment:
    strategy:
      type: "RollingUpdate"
    updateStrategy:
      type: "RollingUpdate"
    budget:
      maxUnavailable: 1
----

For all available settings, see the xref:reference:connector-helm-spec.adoc#deployment[Helm specification].

=== Probes

Probes determine the health and readiness of your Pods. Configure them based on the startup behavior of your connectors.

[source,yaml]
----
connectors:
  deployment:
    livenessProbe:
      initialDelaySeconds: 60
      periodSeconds: 10
    readinessProbe:
      initialDelaySeconds: 30
      periodSeconds: 10
----

For all available settings, see the xref:reference:connector-helm-spec.adoc#deployment[Helm specification].

=== Deployment history

Keeping track of your deployment's history is beneficial for rollback scenarios. Adjust the `revisionHistoryLimit` according to your storage considerations.

[source,yaml]
----
connectors:
  deployment:
    progressDeadlineSeconds: 600
    revisionHistoryLimit: 10
----

For all available settings, see the xref:reference:connector-helm-spec.adoc#deployment[Helm specification].

=== Affinity rules

Affinities control Pod placement in the cluster based on various conditions. Set these according to your high availability and infrastructure needs.

[source,yaml,lines=8+16]
----
connectors:
  deployment:
    podAntiAffinity:
      topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
      type: hard
      weight: 100
      custom:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
            matchExpressions:
            - key: "app"
              operator: "In"
              values:
              - "redpanda-connector"
          topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
        preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - weight: 100
          podAffinityTerm:
            labelSelector:
              matchExpressions:
              - key: "app"
                operator: "In"
                values:
                - "redpanda-connector"
            topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/zone"
----

In this example:

- The `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` section ensures that the Kubernetes scheduler doesn't place two Pods with the same `app: redpanda-connector` label on the same node due to the `topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname`.

- The `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` section is a soft rule that tries to ensure the Kubernetes scheduler doesn't place two Pods with the same `app: redpanda-connector` label in the same zone. However, if it's not possible, the scheduler can still place the Pods in the same zone.

For all available settings, see the xref:reference:connector-helm-spec.adoc#deployment[Helm specification].

=== Graceful shutdown

If your connectors require additional time for a graceful shutdown, modify the `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`.

[source,yaml]
----
connectors:
  deployment:
    terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
----

For all available settings, see the xref:reference:connector-helm-spec.adoc#deployment[Helm specification].

=== Service account

Restricting permissions is a best practice. Assign a dedicated service account for each deployment or app.

[source,yaml]
----
connectors:
  serviceAccount:
    create: true
    name: "redpanda-connector-service-account"
----

For all available settings, see the xref:reference:connector-helm-spec.adoc#serviceaccount[Helm specification].

=== Producers

When a source connector retrieves data from an external system for Redpanda, it assumes the role of a producer:

* The source connector is responsible for transforming the external data into Kafka-compatible messages.
* It then produces (writes) these messages to a specified Kafka topic.

The `producerBatchSize` and `producerLingerMS` settings specify how Kafka Connect groups messages before producing them.

[source,yaml]
----
connectors:
  connectors:
    producerBatchSize: 131072
    producerLingerMS: 1
----

For all available settings, see the xref:reference:connector-helm-spec.adoc#connectors[Helm specification].

=== Topics

Kafka Connect leverages internal topics to track processed data, enhancing its fault tolerance:

* The offset topic logs the last processed position from the external data source.
* In events like failures or restarts, the connector uses this logged position to resume operations, ensuring no data duplication or omission.

[source,yaml]
----
connectors:
  connectors:
    storage:
      topic:
        offset: _internal_connectors_offsets
----

Here, `_internal_connectors_offsets` is the dedicated Kafka topic where Kafka Connect persists the offsets of the source connector.

For all available settings, see the xref:reference:connector-helm-spec.adoc#connectors[Helm specification].

== Verify the deployment

To verify that the deployment was successful, you can use either Redpanda Console or the Kafka Connect REST API:

=== Verify in Redpanda Console

. Expose Redpanda Console to your localhost:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl --namespace <namespace> port-forward svc/redpanda-console 8080:8080
----
+
This command actively runs in the command-line window. To execute other commands while the command is running, open another command-line window.

. Open Redpanda Console on http://localhost:8080.

. Go to *Connectors*.

You should see:

- A list of available connectors (types)
- The address of your Kafka Connect cluster
- The version of Kafka Connect that you are running

From here, you can create and configure instances of your connectors.

=== Verify with the Kafka Connect REST API

. Get the name of the Pod that's running Redpanda Connectors:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=connectors --namespace <namespace>
----

. View the version of Kafka Connect:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl exec <pod-name> --namespace <namespace> -- curl localhost:8083 | jq
----
+

    "type": "source",
    "version": "3.5.1"
  }
]
----
====

== Install a new connector

To install new connectors other than the ones included in the Redpanda Connectors Docker image, you must:

. Prepare a JAR (Java archive) file for the connector.
. Mount the JAR file into the plugin directory of the Redpanda Connectors Docker image.
. Use that Docker image in the Helm chart.

=== Prepare a JAR file

Kafka Connect is written in Java. As such, connectors are also written in Java and packaged into JAR files. JAR files are used to distribute Java classes and associated metadata and resources in a single file. You can get JAR files for connectors in many ways, including:

- *Build from source*: If you have the source code for a Java project, you can compile and package it into a JAR using build tools, such as:

** Maven: Using the `mvn package` command.
** Gradle: Using the `gradle jar` or `gradle build` command.
** Java Development Kit (JDK): Using the `jar` command-line tool that comes with the JDK.

- *Maven Central Repository*: If you're looking for a specific Java library or framework, it may be available in the Maven Central Repository. From here, you can search for the library and download the JAR directly.

- *Vendor websites*: If you are looking for commercial Java software or libraries, the vendor's official website is a good place to check.

CAUTION: To avoid security risks, always verify the source of the JAR files. Do not download JAR files from unknown websites. Malicious JAR files can present a security risk to your execution environment.

=== Add the connector to the Docker image

The Redpanda Connectors Docker image is configured to find connectors in the `/opt/kafka/redpanda-plugins` directory. You must mount your connector's JAR file to this directory in the Docker image.

. Create a new Dockerfile:
+
.`Dockerfile`
[,dockerfile]
----
FROM redpandadata/connectors:<version>

COPY <path-to-jar-file> /opt/kafka/connect-plugins/<connector-name>/<jar-filename>
----
+
Replace the following placeholders:
+
- `<version>`: The version of the Redpanda Connectors Docker image that you want to use. For all available versions, see {link-dockerhub}[DockerHub].
- `<path-to-jar-file>`: The path to the JAR file on your local system.
- `<connector-name>`: A unique directory name in which to mount your JAR files.
- `<jar-filename>`: The name of your JAR file, including the `.jar` file extension.

. Change into the directory where you created the Dockerfile and run:
+
[,bash]
----
docker build -t <repo>/connectors:<version> .
----
+
- Replace `<repo>` with the name of your Docker repository and `<version>` with your desired version or tag for the image.

. Push the image to your Docker repository:
+
[,bash]
----
docker push <repo>/connectors:<version>
----

=== Deploy the Helm chart with your custom Docker image

. Modify the Helm values in the Redpanda Helm chart to use your new Docker image to deploy the Redpanda Connectors Helm chart:
+
[,yaml]
----
connectors:
  image:
    repository: <repo>/connectors
    tag: <version>
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
----
+
Kafka Connect should discover the new connector automatically on startup.

. Get the name of the Pod that's running Redpanda Connectors:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=connectors --namespace <namespace>
----

. View all available connectors:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl exec <pod-name> --namespace <namespace> -- curl localhost:8083/connector-plugins | jq
----

You should see your new connector in the list.
