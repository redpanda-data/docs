:description: Steps to deploy a Redpanda sandbox cluster.
:env-linux: true
:page-categories: Deployment

You can deploy Redpanda using well-known configuration properties optimized for a development or test environment. This configuration uses less system resources and simplifies setup, but it's not suitable for a production deployment. For example, in xref:reference:rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-mode.adoc#development-mode[development mode], the default `group_topic_partitions` is 3, and the default `storage_min_free_bytes` is 1 GiB. In production mode, the default `group_topic_partitions` is 16, and the default `storage_min_free_bytes` is 5 GiB.

[NOTE]
====
* Development mode has write caching enabled by default, which is a relaxed mode of xref:develop:produce-data/configure-producers.adoc#acksall[`acks=all`] that provides better performance at the expense of durability. It acknowledges a message as soon as it is received and acknowledged on a majority of brokers, without waiting for it to fsync to disk. This provides lower latency while still ensuring that a majority of brokers acknowledge the write. For more information, or to disable this, see xref:develop:config-topics.adoc#configure-write-caching[write caching].
* Development mode also bypasses `fsync`, acknowledging messages before they're stored to disk. This reduces the durability of messages, could cause potential data loss, and could give unrealistic performance characteristics for a production environment.

To deploy for a production environment, see xref:./production-deployment.adoc[Deploy for Production]. Or to try out Redpanda in Docker, see xref:get-started:quick-start.adoc[Redpanda Quickstart].

== Prerequisites
