= Deploy for Development
:description: Steps to deploy a Redpanda sandbox cluster.

You can deploy Redpanda using well-known configuration properties optimized for a development or test environment. This configuration uses less system resources and simplifies setup, but it's not suitable for a production deployment. For example, in xref:reference:rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-mode.adoc#development-mode[development mode], the default `group_topic_partitions` is 3, and the default `storage_min_free_bytes` is 1 GiB. In production mode, the default `group_topic_partitions` is 16, and the default `storage_min_free_bytes` is 5 GiB.

[NOTE]
====
Development mode bypasses `fsync`, acknowledging messages before they're stored to disk. This reduces the durability of messages, could cause potential data loss, and could give unrealistic performance data for a production environment.

See xref:./production-deployment.adoc[Deploy for Production] to deploy for a production environment.

See xref:get-started:quick-start.adoc[Redpanda Quickstart] to try out Redpanda in Docker.
====

== Prerequisites

Make sure you meet the xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/manual/production/requirements.adoc[hardware and software requirements].

=== TCP/IP ports

Redpanda uses the following default ports:

|===
| Port | Purpose

| `9092`
| Kafka API

| `8082`
| HTTP Proxy

| `8081`
| Schema Registry

| `9644`
| Admin API and Prometheus

| `33145`
| internal RPC
|===

== Install Redpanda

Install Redpanda on each system you want to be part of your cluster. There are binaries available for Fedora/RedHat or Debian systems.

You can also install Redpanda using an xref:./production-deployment-automation.adoc[Ansible playbook].

=====
Fedora/RedHat::
+
--
[,bash]
----
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.redpanda.com/nzc4ZYQK3WRGd9sy/redpanda/cfg/setup/bash.rpm.sh' | \
sudo -E bash && sudo yum install redpanda -y

sudo -E bash && sudo apt install redpanda -y
----

== Install Redpanda Console

Redpanda Console is a developer-friendly web UI for managing and debugging your Redpanda cluster and your applications. Install Redpanda Console alongside a Redpanda cluster.

For each new release, Redpanda compiles the Redpanda Console to a single binary for Linux, macOS, and Windows. You can find the binaries in the attachments of each release on https://github.com/redpanda-data/console/releases[GitHub^].

== Start Redpanda

Configure Redpanda using the xref:reference:rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-config-bootstrap.adoc[`rpk redpanda config bootstrap`] command, then start Redpanda:

[,bash]
----
sudo rpk redpanda config bootstrap --self <private-ip> --ips <seed-server-ips> && \
sudo rpk redpanda config set redpanda.empty_seed_starts_cluster false && \
sudo systemctl start redpanda
----

* The `--self` flag tells Redpanda the interface address to bind to. Usually this is its private IP.
* The `--ips` flag lists all the seed servers in the cluster, including the one being started. Seed servers correspond to the `seed_servers` property in `redpanda.yaml`.
+
[NOTE]
====
* The `--ips` flag must be set _identically_ (with nodes listed in identical order) on each node.
* Do not run `sudo rpk redpanda tune all` on development deployments.
====

When a Redpanda cluster starts, it instantiates a controller Raft group with all the seed servers that are specified in the `--ips` flag. After all seed servers complete their startup procedure and become accessible, the cluster is then available. After that, non-seed servers start up and are added to the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* It's important to have one or more seed servers in each fault domain (such as rack or cloud AZ). A higher number provides a stronger guarantee that clusters don't fracture unintentionally.
* It's possible to change the seed servers for a short period of time after a cluster has been created. For example, you may want to designate one additional broker as a seed server to increase availability. To do this without cluster downtime, add the new broker to xref:reference:node-properties.adoc[`seed_servers`] and restart Redpanda to apply the change on a broker-by-broker basis.
* If firewall ports block the internal RPC port `33145`, then the non-seed servers could take time to fail. If that happens, run `sudo systemctl stop redpanda` (or `yum remove redpanda` or `apt-get remove redpanda`), fix the firewall issue, and then start Redpanda again.
====

== Start Redpanda Console

. Start Redpanda Console:
+
[,bash]
----
sudo systemctl start redpanda-console
----

. Make sure that Redpanda Console is active and running:
+
[,bash]
----
sudo systemctl status redpanda-console
----

== Verify the installation

To verify that the Redpanda cluster is up and running, use `rpk` to get information about the cluster:

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster info
----

To create a topic:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic create panda
----

== Next steps

* If clients connect from a different subnet, see xref:manage:security/listener-configuration.adoc[Configure Listeners].
* Observability is essential. See xref:manage:monitoring.adoc[].
