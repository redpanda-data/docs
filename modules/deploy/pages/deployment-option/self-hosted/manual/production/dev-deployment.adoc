:description: Steps to deploy a Redpanda sandbox cluster.
:env-linux: true
:page-categories: Deployment

You can deploy Redpanda using well-known configuration properties optimized for a development or test environment. This configuration uses less system resources and simplifies setup, but it's not suitable for a production deployment. For example, in xref:reference:rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-mode.adoc#development-mode[development mode], the default `group_topic_partitions` is 3, and the default `storage_min_free_bytes` is 1 GiB. In production mode, the default `group_topic_partitions` is 16, and the default `storage_min_free_bytes` is 5 GiB.

[NOTE]
====
Development mode bypasses `fsync`, acknowledging messages before they're stored to disk. This reduces the durability of messages, could cause potential data loss, and could give unrealistic performance data for a production environment.

See xref:./production-deployment.adoc[Deploy for Production] to deploy for a production environment.

See xref:get-started:quick-start.adoc[Redpanda Quickstart] to try out Redpanda in Docker.
