= Automated Deployment
:description: Deploy Redpanda using automation tools like Terraform and Ansible.
:page-aliases: deploy-self-hosted:production-deployment-automation.adoc, deployment:production-deployment-automation.adoc

If you use automation tools like Terraform and Ansible in your environment, you can use them to quickly provision a Redpanda cluster. Terraform can set up the infrastructure and output a properly-formatted `hosts.ini` file, and Ansible can use that `hosts.ini` file as input to install Redpanda.

If you already have an infrastructure provisioning framework, you can supply your own hosts file (without using Terraform), and you can use Ansible to install Redpanda.

This recommended automated deployment provides a production-usable way to deploy and maintain a cluster. For unique configurations, you can work directly with the Ansible and Terraform modules to integrate them into your environment.

== Prerequisites

. Install Terraform following the https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli[Terraform documentation^].
. Install Ansible following the https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html[Ansible documentation^]. Different operating systems may have specific Ansible dependencies.
. Clone the https://github.com/redpanda-data/deployment-automation/[`deployment-automation` GitHub repository^]:
+
[,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/redpanda-data/deployment-automation.git
----

. Change into the directory:
+
[,bash]
----
cd deployment-automation
----

== Use Terraform to set up infrastructure

[tabs]
=====
AWS::
+
--
The recommended https://registry.terraform.io/modules/redpanda-data/redpanda-cluster/aws/latest[Terraform module for Redpanda^] deploys virtual machines on AWS EC2. To create an AWS Redpanda cluster, review the https://github.com/redpanda-data/deployment-automation/blob/main/aws/main.tf[default variables^] and make any edits necessary for your environment.

. In the `deployment-automation` folder, change into the `aws` directory:
+
```bash
cd aws
```

. Set AWS credentials. Terraform provides multiple ways to set the AWS secret and key. See the https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#environment-variables[Terraform documentation^].
. Initialize Terraform:
+
```bash
terraform init
```

. Create the cluster with `terraform apply`:
+
[,bash]
----
terraform apply -var='public_key_path=~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub' -var='subnet_id=<subnet-id>' -var='vpc_id=<vpc-id>'
----
+
* Terraform configures `public_key_path` on the brokers to remotely connect with SSH. If the public key path isn't the default `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, then you need to set it.
* If you don't have a default VPC defined, then you need to set `subnet_id` and `vpc_id`.

Configuration options (for the full list, see the https://registry.terraform.io/modules/redpanda-data/redpanda-cluster/aws/latest[Terraform module^]):

GCP::
+
--
. In the `deployment-automation` folder, change into the `gcp` directory:
+
[,bash]
----
cd gcp
----

. You need an existing subnet in which to deploy the virtual machines (VMs). The subnet's attached firewall should allow inbound traffic on ports 22, 3000, 8082, 8888, 8889, 9090,  9092, 9644, and 33145. This module adds the `rp-node` tag to the deployed VMs, which can be used as the target tag for the firewall rule.
. Initialize Terraform:
+
```bash
terraform init
```

. Create the cluster:
+
[,bash]
----
terraform apply
----

The following example creates a three-broker cluster using the subnet named `redpanda-cluster-subnet`:

```bash
terraform apply -var nodes=3 -var subnet=redpanda-cluster-subnet -var public_key_path=~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -var ssh_user=$USER
```

== Use Ansible to install Redpanda

. From the https://github.com/redpanda-data/deployment-automation/[`deployment-automation`^] folder, set the required Ansible variables:
+
[,bash]
----
export CLOUD_PROVIDER=<aws-or-gcp>
export ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATHS=${PWD}/artifacts/collections
export ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH=${PWD}/artifacts/roles
export ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=${PWD}/${CLOUD_PROVIDER}/hosts.ini
----

. Install the roles required by Ansible:
+
[,bash]
----
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
----

=== Configure a hosts file

TIP: Redpanda Data recommends incorporating variables into your `hosts.ini` file for every host. Edits made to properties outside of the playbook may be overwritten.

If you used Terraform to deploy the instances, the `hosts.ini` is configured automatically in the https://github.com/redpanda-data/deployment-automation/tree/main/artifacts[`artifacts`^] directory.

If you didn't use Terraform, then you must manually update the `[redpanda]` section. When you open the file, you see something like the following:

[,ini]
----
[redpanda]
ip ansible_user=ssh_user ansible_become=True private_ip=pip id=0
ip ansible_user=ssh_user ansible_become=True private_ip=pip id=1

[monitor]
ip ansible_user=ssh_user ansible_become=True private_ip=pip id=1
----

Under the `[redpanda]` section, replace the following:

|===
| Property | Description

| `ip`
| The public IP address of the machine.

| `ansible_user`
| The username for Ansible to use to SSH to the machine.

| `private_ip`
| The private IP address of the machine. This could be the same as the public IP address.
|===

You can add additional properties to configure features like rack awareness and Tiered Storage.

The `[monitor]` section is only required if you want the playbook to install and configure a basic Prometheus and Grafana setup for observability. If you have a centralized monitoring setup or if you don't require monitoring, then remove this section.

=== Run a playbook

Use the https://galaxy.ansible.com/redpanda/cluster[Ansible Collection for Redpanda^] to build a Redpanda cluster. The recommended Redpanda playbook enables TLS encryption and Tiered Storage.

If you prefer, you can download the modules and required roles and create your own playbook. For example, if you want to handle your own data directory, you can toggle that part off, and Redpanda ensures that the permissions are correct. If you want to generate your own security certificates, you can.

To install and start a Redpanda cluster in one command with the Redpanda playbook, run:

[,bash]
----
ansible-playbook --private-key <your-private-key> -v ansible/playbooks/provision-basic-cluster.yml
----

[NOTE]
====
* The private key corresponds to the public key in the `distro_user` SSH configuration.
* To use your own playbook, replace `provision-basic-cluster.yml` with your playbook name.
* When you use a playbook to create a cluster, you should also use the playbook for subsequent operations, like upgrades. The Ansible modules safely handle rolling upgrades, but you must comply with xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/rolling-upgrade.adoc[Redpanda version path requirements].
====

==== Custom configuration

You can specify any available Redpanda configuration value, or set of values, by passing a JSON dictionary as an Ansible `extra-var`. These values are spliced with the calculated configuration and only override the values that you specify. Values must be unset manually with `rpk`. There are two sub-dictionaries you can specify: `redpanda.cluster` and `redpanda.node`. For more information, see xref:reference:cluster-properties.adoc[Cluster Configuration Properties] and xref:reference:node-properties.adoc[Broker Configuration Properties].

[,bash]
----
export JSONDATA='{"cluster":{"auto_create_topics_enabled":"true"},"node":{"developer_mode":"false"}}'
ansible-playbook ansible/<playbook-name>.yml --private-key artifacts/testkey -e redpanda="${JSONDATA}"
----

NOTE: Adding whitespace to the JSON breaks configuration merging.

Use `rpk` and standard Kafka tools to produce and consume from the Redpanda cluster.

==== Configure Prometheus and Grafana

Include a `[monitor]` section in your hosts file if you want the playbook to install and configure a basic Prometheus and Grafana setup for observability. Redpanda emits Prometheus metrics that can be scrapped with a central collector. If you already have a centralized monitoring setup or if you don't require monitoring, then this is unnecessary.

To run the `deploy-prometheus-grafana.yml` playbook:

[,bash]
----
ansible-playbook ansible/deploy-prometheus-grafana.yml \
--private-key '<path-to-a-private-key-with-ssh-access-to-the-hosts>'
----

==== Configure Redpanda Console

To install Redpanda Console, add the `redpanda_broker` role to a group with `install_console: true`. The standard playbooks automatically install Redpanda Console on hosts in the `[client]` group. 

==== Build the cluster with TLS enabled

Configure TLS with externally-provided and signed certificates. Then run the `provision-tls-cluster` playbook, specifying the certificate locations on new hosts. You can either pass the variables in the command line or edit the file and pass them there. Consider whether you want public access to the Kafka API and Admin API endpoints. For example:

[,bash]
----
ansible-playbook ansible/provision-tls-cluster.yml \
--private-key '<path-to-a-private-key-with-ssh-access-to-the-hosts>' \
--extra-vars create_demo_certs=false \
--extra-vars advertise_public_ips=false \
--extra-vars handle_certs=false \
--extra-vars redpanda_truststore_file='<path-to-ca.crt-file>'
----

It is important to use a signed certificate from a valid CA for production environments. The playbook uses locally-signed certificates that are not recommended for production use. Provide a valid certificate using these variables:

[,bash]
----
redpanda_certs_dir: /etc/redpanda/certs
redpanda_csr_file: "{{ redpanda_certs_dir }}/node.csr"
redpanda_key_file: "{{ redpanda_certs_dir }}/node.key"
redpanda_cert_file: "{{ redpanda_certs_dir }}/node.crt"
redpanda_truststore_file: "{{ redpanda_certs_dir }}/truststore.pem"
----

For testing, you could deploy a local CA to generate private keys and signed certificates:

[,bash]
----
ansible-playbook ansible/provision-tiered-storage-cluster.yml \
--private-key '<path-to-a-private-key-with-ssh-access-to-the-hosts>'
----

==== Add brokers to an existing cluster

To add brokers to a cluster, you must add them to the hosts file and run the relevant playbook again. You can add `skip_node=true` to the existing hosts to avoid the playbooks being rerun on them.

==== Upgrade a cluster

The playbook is designed to be idempotent, so it should be suitable for running as part of a CI/CD pipeline or through Ansible Tower. The playbook upgrades the packages and then performs a rolling upgrade, where one broker at a time is upgraded and safely restarted. For all upgrade requirements and recommendations, see xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/rolling-upgrade.adoc[Upgrade Redpanda]. It is important to test that your upgrade path is safe before using it in production.

To upgrade a cluster, run the playbook with a specific target version:

[,bash]
----
ansible-playbook --private-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa ansible/<playbook-name>.yml -e redpanda_version=22.3.10-1
----

By default, the playbook selects the latest version of the Redpanda packages, but an upgrade is only performed if the `redpanda_install_status` variable is set to `latest`:

[,bash]
----
ansible-playbook --private-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa ansible/<playbook-name>.yml -e redpanda_install_status=latest
----

To upgrade clusters with SASL authentication:

[,bash]
----
export JSONDATA='{"cluster":{"auto_create_topics_enabled":"true"},"node":{"developer_mode":"false"}}'
ansible-playbook ansible/<playbook-name>.yml --private-key artifacts/testkey -e redpanda="${JSONDATA}"
----

Similarly, you can put the `redpanda_rpk_opts` into a YAML file protected with Ansible vault.

[,bash]
----
ansible-playbook --private-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa ansible/<playbook-name>.yml --extra-vars=redpanda_install_status=latest --extra-vars @vault-file.yml --ask-vault-pass
----

==== Redpanda Ansible Collection values

You can pass the following variables as `-e var=value` when running Ansible:

|===
| Property | Default value | Description

| `redpanda_organization`
| `redpanda-test`
| Set this to identify your organization in the asset management system.

| `redpanda_cluster_id`
| `redpanda`
| This helps identify the cluster.

| `advertise_public_ips`
| `false`
| Configure Redpanda to advertise the broker's public IPs for client communication instead of private IPs. This enables using the cluster from outside its subnet.

Note: This is not recommended for production deployments, because your brokers will be public.

| `grafana_admin_pass`
| `<your-secure-password>`
| Grafana admin user's password.

| `ephemeral_disk`
| `false`
| Enable file system check for attached disk.

This is useful when using attached disks in instances with ephemeral operating system disks like Azure L Series. This allows a file system repair at boot time and ensures that the drive is remounted automatically after a reboot.

| `redpanda_mode`
| `production`
| Enables hardware optimization.

| `redpanda_admin_api_port`
| `9644`
|

| `redpanda_kafka_port`
| `9092`
|

| `redpanda_rpc_port`
| `33145`
|

| `redpanda_schema_registry_port`
| `8081`
|

| `is_using_unstable`
| `false`
| Enables access to unstable builds.

| `redpanda_version`
| `latest`
| Version; for example, 22.2.2-1 or 22.3.1~rc1-1. If this value is set, then the package is upgraded if the installed version is lower than what has been specified.

| `redpanda_rpk_opts`
|
| Command line options to be passed to instances where `rpk` is used on the playbook. For example, superuser credentials can be specified as `--user myuser --password mypassword`.

| `redpanda_install_status`
| `present`
| If `redpanda_version` is set to `latest`, then changing `redpanda_install_status` to `latest` causes an upgrade; otherwise, the currently-installed version remains.

| `redpanda_data_directory`
| `/var/lib/redpanda/data`
| Path where Redpanda keeps its data.

| `redpanda_key_file`
| `/etc/redpanda/certs/node.key`
| TLS: Path to private key.

| `redpanda_cert_file`
| `/etc/redpanda/certs/node.crt`
| TLS: Path to signed certificate.

| `redpanda_truststore_file`
| `/etc/redpanda/certs/truststore.pem`
| TLS: Path to truststore.

| `tls`
| `false`
| Set to `true` to configure Redpanda to use TLS. This can be set on each broker, although this may lead to errors configuring `rpk`.

| `skip_node`
| `false`
| Broker configuration to prevent the redpanda_broker role being applied to this specific broker. Use carefully when adding new brokers to avoid existing brokers from being reconfigured.

| `restart_node`
| `false`
| Broker configuration to prevent Redpanda brokers from being restarted after updating. Use with care: This can cause `rpk` to be reconfigured but the broker is not restarted and therefore is in an inconsistent state.

| `rack`
| `undefined`
| Broker configuration to enable rack awareness. Rack awareness is enabled cluster-wide if at least one broker has this set.

| `tiered_storage_bucket_name`
|
| Set bucket name to enable Tiered Storage.

| `schema_registry_replication_factor`
| 1
| The replication factor of Schema Registry's internal storage topic.

| `aws_region`
|
| The region to be used if Tiered Storage is enabled.
