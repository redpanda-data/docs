:description: Steps to deploy a Redpanda production cluster

To start deploying for production, choose the guide for your deployment type:

* <<default-deployment,*Default deployment*>> - use default supported deployment tools.
* <<custom-deployment,*Custom deployment*>> - use custom unsupported deployment tools.

== Default deployment

This section describes how to set up a production cluster of Redpanda.

See also:

* xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization.adoc[Manage Disk Space] for guidelines on cluster creation
* xref:get-started:quick-start.adoc[Redpanda Quickstart] to try out Redpanda

=== Prepare infrastructure

Provision hardware according to these requirements:

* XFS for the data directory of Redpanda (`/var/lib/redpanda/data`). NFS is not supported.
* A kernel that is at least 3.10.0-514, 4.18 or newer
* Local NVMe, RAID-0 when using multiple disks
* 2GB of memory per core
* TCP ports:
 ** `33145` - internal RPC
 ** `9092` - Kafka API
 ** `8082` - HTTP Proxy
 ** `8081` - Schema Registry
 ** `9644` - Prometheus and Admin API

NOTE: You can xref:./production-deployment-automation.adoc[use Terraform to deploy Redpanda].

=== Install Redpanda

Install Redpanda on each system you want to be part of your cluster. There are binaries available for Fedora/RedHat or Debian systems.

You can also install Redpanda using an xref:./production-deployment-automation.adoc[Ansible playbook].

=== Set Redpanda to production mode

By default, Redpanda is installed in development mode, which turns off hardware optimization.

To enable hardware optimization, set Redpanda to run in production mode:

[,bash]
----
sudo rpk redpanda mode production
----

To tune the hardware, on each node, run:

[,bash]
----
sudo rpk redpanda tune all
----

For more details, see the xref:reference:rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-tune.adoc[autotuner reference].

.Optional: Benchmark your SSD
[NOTE]
====
On taller machines, Redpanda recommends benchmarking your SSD. This can be done
with xref:reference:rpk/rpk-iotune.adoc[rpk iotune]. You only need to run this once.

For reference, a local NVMe SSD should yield around 1GB/s sustained writes.
`rpk iotune` captures SSD wear and tear and gives accurate measurements
of what your hardware is capable of delivering. Run this before benchmarking.

If you're on AWS, GCP, or Azure, creating a new instance and upgrading to
an image with a recent Linux kernel version is often the easiest way to
work around bad devices.

[,bash]
----
sudo rpk iotune # takes 10mins
----

====

=== Start Redpanda

Configure Redpanda using the xref:reference:rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-config-bootstrap.adoc[`rpk redpanda config bootstrap`] command, then start Redpanda:

[,bash]
----
sudo rpk redpanda config bootstrap --self <private-ip> --ips <seed-node-ips> && \
sudo rpk redpanda config set redpanda.empty_seed_starts_cluster false && \
sudo systemctl start redpanda-tuner redpanda
----

* The `--self` flag tells Redpanda the interface address to bind to. Usually this is its private IP.
* The `--ips` flag lists all the seed nodes in the cluster, including the one being started. Seed nodes correspond to the `seed_servers` property in `redpanda.yaml`.
+
NOTE: The `--ips` flag must be set _identically_ (with nodes listed in identical order) on each node.

When a Redpanda cluster starts, it instantiates a controller Raft group with all the seed nodes that are specified in the `--ips` flag. After all seed nodes complete their startup procedure and become accessible, the cluster is then available. After that, non-seed nodes start up and are added to the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
* Redpanda strongly recommends at least three seed nodes when forming a cluster. A larger number of seed nodes increases the robustness of consensus and minimizes any chance that new clusters get spuriously formed after nodes are lost or restarted without any data.
* It's important to have one or more seed nodes in each fault domain (such as rack or cloud AZ). A higher number provides a stronger guarantee that clusters don't fracture unintentionally.
* It's possible to change the seed nodes for a short period of time after a cluster has been created. For example, you may want to designate one additional broker as a seed node to increase availability. To do this without cluster downtime, add the new broker to xref:reference:node-properties:.adoc[`seed_servers`] and restart Redpanda to apply the change on a broker-by-broker basis.
====

=== Start Redpanda Console

. Start Redpanda Console:
+
[,bash]
----
sudo systemctl start redpanda-console
----

. Make sure that Redpanda Console is active and running:
+
[,bash]
----
sudo systemctl status redpanda-console
----

=== Verify the installation

To verify that the Redpanda cluster is up and running, check the logs:

[,bash]
----
journalctl -u redpanda
----

If topics were initially created in a test environment with a replication factor of `1`, use `rpk topic alter-config` to change the topic replication factor:

----
rpk topic alter-config [TOPICS...] --set replication.factor=3
----

To create a topic:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic create panda
----

== Custom deployment

This section provides information for creating your own automation for deploying Redpanda clusters without using any of the tools that Redpanda supports for setting up a cluster:

* Ansible Playbook
* Helm Chart
* Kubernetes Operator

TIP: Redpanda strongly recommends using one of these supported deployment tools. See xref:./production-deployment-automation.adoc[Automate Deploying for Production].

=== Configure bootstrapping

Redpanda cluster configuration is written with the Admin API and
the `rpk cluster config` CLIs.

In the special case where you want to provide configuration to Redpanda
before it starts for the first time, you can write a `.bootstrap.yaml` file
in the same directory as `redpanda.yaml`.

This file is only read on the first startup of the cluster. Any subsequent
changes to `.bootstrap.yaml` are ignored, so changes to
cluster configuration must be done with the Admin API.

The content format is a YAML dictionary of cluster configuration properties. For example, to initialize a cluster with Admin API authentication enabled
and a single superuser, the `.bootstrap.yaml` file would contain the following:

[,yaml]
----
admin_api_require_auth: true
superusers:
- alice
----

With this configuration, the Admin API is not accessible until you bootstrap a user account.

=== Bootstrap a user account

When using username/password authentication, it's helpful to be able to create one user before the cluster starts for the first time.

Do this by setting the `RP_BOOTSTRAP_USER` environment variable
when starting Redpanda for the first time. The value has the format
`<username>:<password>`. For example, you could set `RP_BOOTSTRAP_USER` to `alice:letmein`.

NOTE: `RP_BOOTSTRAP_USER` only creates a user account. You must still
set up authentication using cluster configuration.

=== Secure the Admin API

The Admin API is used to create SASL user accounts and ACLs, so it's
important to think about how you secure it when creating a cluster.

* No authentication, but listening only on 127.0.0.1: This may be appropriate
if your Redpanda processes are running in an environment where only
administrators can access the host.
* mTLS authentication: You can generate client and server x509 certificates
before starting Redpanda for the first time, refer to them in
`redpanda.yaml`, and use the client certificate when accessing the Admin API.
* Username/password authentication: Use the combination of `admin_api_require_auth`,
`superusers`, and `RP_BOOTSTRAP_USER` to access the Admin API username/password
authentication. You probably still want to enable TLS on the Admin API
endpoint to protect credentials in flight.

=== Configure the seed servers

Seed servers help new nodes join a cluster by directing requests from newly-started nodes to an existing cluster. The xref:reference:node-properties.adoc#seed_servers[seed_servers] node configuration property controls how Redpanda finds its peers when initially forming a cluster. It is dependent on the xref:reference:node-properties.adoc#empty_seed_starts_cluster[empty_seed_starts_cluster] node configuration property.

Starting in Redpanda version 22.3, you should explicitly set `empty_seed_starts_cluster` to `false` on every node, and every node in the cluster should have the same value set for `seed_servers`. With this set of configurations, Redpanda clusters form with these guidelines:

* When a node starts and it is a seed server (its address is in the `seed_servers` list), it waits for all other seed servers to start up, and it forms a cluster with all seed servers as members.
* When a node starts and it is not a seed server, it sends requests to the seed servers to join the cluster.

It is essential that all seed servers have identical values for the `seed_servers` list. Redpanda strongly recommends at least three seed nodes when forming a cluster. Each seed server decreases the likelihood of unintentionally forming a split brain cluster. To ensure nodes can always discover the cluster, at least one seed node should be available at all times.

By default, for backward compatibility, `empty_seed_starts_cluster` is set to `true`, and Redpanda clusters form with the guidelines used prior to version 22.3:

* When a node starts with an empty `seed_servers` list, it creates a single node cluster with itself as the only member.
* When a node starts with a non-empty `seed_servers` list, it sends requests to the nodes in that list to join the cluster.

You should never have more than one node with an empty `seed_servers` list, which would result in the creation of multiple clusters.

IMPORTANT: Redpanda expects its storage to be persistent, and it's an error to erase a node's drive and restart it. However, in some environments (like when migrating to a different node pool on Kubernetes), truly persistent storage is unavailable, and nodes may find their data volumes erased. For such environments, Redpanda recommends setting `empty_seed_starts_cluster` to false and designating a set of seed nodes such that they couldn't lose their storage simultaneously.

=== Configure node IDs

Redpanda automatically generates unique node IDs for each new node. This means that you don't need to include node IDs in configuration files or worry about policies on `node_id` re-use.

If you choose to assign node IDs, make sure to use a fresh `node_id` each time you add a node to the cluster.

CAUTION: Never reuse node IDs, even for nodes that have been decommissioned and restarted empty. Doing so can result in an inconsistent state.

=== Upgrade considerations

Deployment automation should place each node into maintenance mode and wait for it to drain leaderships before restarting it with a newer version of Redpanda. For information about how to drive a rolling upgrade of a Redpanda cluster, see xref:manage:node-management.adoc[Node Maintenance Mode].

Rolling restarts preserve high availability and reduce
risk during upgrades. Check the cluster's health after upgrading each node. Rolling
back an upgrade to an earlier feature release is only supported until the last node
has been updated, so it's important to identify any issues before that point.
