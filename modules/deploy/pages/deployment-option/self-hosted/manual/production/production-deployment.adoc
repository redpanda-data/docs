You can deploy Redpanda for production with a default deployment, which uses recommended deployment tools, or with a custom deployment, which uses unsupported deployment tools.

[NOTE]
====
* See xref:./production-deployment-automation.adoc[Automate Deployment for Production] to use Terraform and Ansible to deploy Redpanda.
* See xref:get-started:quick-start.adoc[Redpanda Quickstart] to try out Redpanda in Docker or xref:./dev-deployment.adoc[Deploy for Development].
====

== Prerequisites

Make sure you meet the xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/manual/production/requirements.adoc[hardware and software requirements].

=== TCP/IP ports

Redpanda uses the following default ports:

|===
| Port | Purpose

| `9092`
| Kafka API

| `8082`
| HTTP Proxy

| `8081`
| Schema Registry

| `9644`
| Admin API and Prometheus

| `33145`
| internal RPC
|===

== Select deployment type

To start deploying Redpanda for production, choose your deployment type:

* <<Default deployment>>: Use recommended deployment tools.
* <<Custom deployment>>: Use unsupported deployment tools.

== Default deployment

This section describes how to set up a production cluster of Redpanda.

=== Install Redpanda

Install Redpanda on each system you want to be part of your cluster. There are binaries available for Fedora/RedHat or Debian systems.

=== Set Redpanda to production mode

By default, Redpanda is installed in development mode, which turns off hardware optimization.

To enable hardware optimization, set Redpanda to run in xref:reference:rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-mode.adoc#production-mode[production mode]:

[,bash]
----
sudo rpk redpanda mode production
----

To tune the hardware, run the autotuner on each node:

[,bash]
----
sudo rpk redpanda tune all
----

[TIP]
====
To run `rpk redpanda tune all` on a Redpanda broker automatically after broker or host restarts, configure the service `redpanda-tuner`, which runs `rpk redpanda tune all`, to run at boot-up:

* For RHEL, after installing the rpm package, run `systemctl` to both start and enable the `redpanda-tuner` service:
+
[,bash]
----
sudo systemctl start redpanda-tuner
sudo systemctl enable redpanda-tuner
----

* For Ubuntu, after installing the apt package, run `systemctl` to start the `redpanda-tuner` service (which is already enabled):
+
[,bash]
----
sudo systemctl start redpanda-tuner
----
====

For more details, see the xref:reference:rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-tune.adoc[autotuner reference].

.Optional: Benchmark your SSD
[NOTE]
====
On taller machines, Redpanda recommends benchmarking your SSD. This can be done
with xref:reference:rpk/rpk-iotune.adoc[rpk iotune]. You only need to run this once.

For reference, a local NVMe SSD should yield around 1 GB/s sustained writes.
`rpk iotune` captures SSD wear and tear and gives accurate measurements
of what your hardware is capable of delivering. Run this before benchmarking.

If you're on AWS, GCP, or Azure, creating a new instance and upgrading to
an image with a recent Linux kernel version is often the easiest way to
work around bad devices.

[,bash]
----
sudo rpk iotune # takes 10mins
----

====

=== Start Redpanda

Configure Redpanda using the xref:reference:rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-config-bootstrap.adoc[`rpk redpanda config bootstrap`] command, then start Redpanda:

[,bash]
----
sudo rpk redpanda config bootstrap --self <ip-address-of-your-node> --ips <seed-server-ips> && \
sudo rpk redpanda config set redpanda.empty_seed_starts_cluster false && \
sudo systemctl start redpanda-tuner redpanda
----

Replace the following placeholders:

* `<ip-address-of-your-node>`: The `--self` flag tells Redpanda the interface address to bind to for the Kafka API, the RPC API, and the Admin API. Usually, this is the node's private IP address.
* `<seed-server-ips>`: The `--ips` flag lists all the seed servers in the cluster, including the one being started. Seed servers correspond to the `seed_servers` property in `redpanda.yaml`.
+
NOTE: The `--ips` flag must be set _identically_ (with nodes listed in identical order) on each node.

When a Redpanda cluster starts, it instantiates a controller Raft group with all the seed servers specified in the `--ips` flag. After all seed servers complete their startup procedure and become accessible, the cluster is then available. After that, non-seed servers start up and are added to the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Redpanda strongly recommends at least three seed servers when forming a cluster. A larger number of seed servers increases the robustness of consensus and minimizes any chance that new clusters get spuriously formed after brokers are lost or restarted without any data.
* It's important to have one or more seed servers in each fault domain (such as rack or cloud AZ). A higher number provides a stronger guarantee that clusters don't fracture unintentionally.
* It's possible to change the seed servers for a short period of time after a cluster has been created. For example, you may want to designate one additional broker as a seed server to increase availability. To do this without cluster downtime, add the new broker to xref:reference:node-properties.adoc[`seed_servers`] and restart Redpanda to apply the change on a broker-by-broker basis.
====

=== Start Redpanda Console

. Start Redpanda Console:
+
[,bash]
----
sudo systemctl start redpanda-console
----

. Make sure that Redpanda Console is active and running:
+
[,bash]
----
sudo systemctl status redpanda-console
----

=== Verify the installation

To verify that the Redpanda cluster is up and running, use `rpk` to get information about the cluster:

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster info
----

If topics were initially created in a test environment with a replication factor of `1`, use `rpk topic alter-config` to change the topic replication factor:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic alter-config [TOPICS...] --set replication.factor=3
----

To create a topic:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic create panda
----

=== Enable monitoring

xref:manage:monitoring.adoc[]. Observability is essential in production environments.

== Custom deployment

This section provides information for creating your own automation for deploying Redpanda clusters without using any of the tools that Redpanda supports for setting up a cluster, such as Ansible Playbook, Helm Chart, or Kubernetes Operator.

TIP: Redpanda strongly recommends using one of these supported deployment tools. See xref:./production-deployment-automation.adoc[Automate Deploying for Production].

=== Configure bootstrapping

Redpanda cluster configuration is written with the Admin API and
the `rpk cluster config` CLIs.

In the special case where you want to provide configuration to Redpanda
before it starts for the first time, you can write a `.bootstrap.yaml` file
in the same directory as `redpanda.yaml`.

This file is only read on the first startup of the cluster. Any subsequent
changes to `.bootstrap.yaml` are ignored, so changes to
cluster configuration must be done with the Admin API.

The content format is a YAML dictionary of cluster configuration properties. For example, to initialize a cluster with Admin API authentication enabled
and a single superuser, the `.bootstrap.yaml` file would contain the following:

[,yaml]
----
admin_api_require_auth: true
superusers:
- alice
----

With this configuration, the Admin API is not accessible until you bootstrap a user account.

=== Bootstrap a user account

When using username/password authentication, it's helpful to be able to create one user before the cluster starts for the first time.

Do this by setting the `RP_BOOTSTRAP_USER` environment variable
when starting Redpanda for the first time. The value has the format
`<username>:<password>`. For example, you could set `RP_BOOTSTRAP_USER` to `alice:letmein`.

NOTE: `RP_BOOTSTRAP_USER` only creates a user account. You must still
set up authentication using cluster configuration.

=== Secure the Admin API

The Admin API is used to create SASL user accounts and ACLs, so it's
important to think about how you secure it when creating a cluster.

* No authentication, but listening only on 127.0.0.1: This may be appropriate
if your Redpanda processes are running in an environment where only
administrators can access the host.
* mTLS authentication: You can generate client and server x509 certificates
before starting Redpanda for the first time, refer to them in
`redpanda.yaml`, and use the client certificate when accessing the Admin API.
* Username/password authentication: Use the combination of `admin_api_require_auth`,
`superusers`, and `RP_BOOTSTRAP_USER` to access the Admin API username/password
authentication. You probably still want to enable TLS on the Admin API
endpoint to protect credentials in flight.

=== Configure the seed servers

Seed servers help new brokers join a cluster by directing requests from newly-started brokers to an existing cluster. The xref:reference:node-properties.adoc#seed_servers[seed_servers] broker configuration property controls how Redpanda finds its peers when initially forming a cluster. It is dependent on the xref:reference:node-properties.adoc#empty_seed_starts_cluster[empty_seed_starts_cluster] broker configuration property.

Starting with Redpanda version 22.3, you should explicitly set `empty_seed_starts_cluster` to `false` on every broker, and every broker in the cluster should have the same value set for `seed_servers`. With this set of configurations, Redpanda clusters form with these guidelines:

* When a broker starts and it is a seed server (its address is in the `seed_servers` list), it waits for all other seed servers to start up, and it forms a cluster with all seed servers as members.
* When a broker starts and it is not a seed server, it sends requests to the seed servers to join the cluster.

It is essential that all seed servers have identical values for the `seed_servers` list. Redpanda strongly recommends at least three seed servers when forming a cluster. Each seed server decreases the likelihood of unintentionally forming a split brain cluster. To ensure brokers can always discover the cluster, at least one seed server should be available at all times.

By default, for backward compatibility, `empty_seed_starts_cluster` is set to `true`, and Redpanda clusters form with the guidelines used prior to version 22.3:

* When a broker starts with an empty `seed_servers` list, it creates a single broker cluster with itself as the only member.
* When a broker starts with a non-empty `seed_servers` list, it sends requests to the brokers in that list to join the cluster.

You should never have more than one broker with an empty `seed_servers` list, which would result in the creation of multiple clusters.

IMPORTANT: Redpanda expects its storage to be persistent, and it's an error
to erase a broker's drive and restart it. However, in some environments (like when migrating to a different Node pool on Kubernetes), truly persistent storage is unavailable,
and brokers may find their data volumes erased. For such environments, Redpanda recommends setting `empty_seed_starts_cluster` to false and designating a set of seed servers such that they couldn't lose their storage simultaneously.

=== Configure broker IDs

Redpanda automatically generates unique IDs for each new broker. This means that you don't need to include IDs in configuration files or worry about policies on `node_id` re-use.

If you choose to assign broker IDs, make sure to use a fresh `node_id` each time you add a broker to the cluster.

CAUTION: Never reuse broker IDs, even for brokers that have been decommissioned and restarted empty. Doing so can result in an inconsistent state.

=== Upgrade considerations

Deployment automation should place each broker into maintenance mode and wait for it to drain leadership before restarting it with a newer version of Redpanda. For more information, see xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/rolling-upgrade.adoc[Upgrade].

If upgrading multiple xref:manage:kubernetes/rolling-upgrade.adoc#find-a-new-version[feature release versions of Redpanda] in succession, make sure to verify that each version upgrades to completion before proceeding to the next version. You can verify by reading the `/v1/features` Admin API endpoint and checking that `cluster_version` has increased.

Starting with Redpanda version 23.1, the `/v1/features` endpoint also includes a `node_latest_version` attribute, and installers can verify that the cluster has activated any new functionality from a previous upgrade by checking for `cluster_version` == `node_latest_version`.
