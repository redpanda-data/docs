To create a Redpanda cluster in your virtual private cloud (VPC), log in to https://cloud.redpanda.com[Redpanda Cloud^]. Enter your organization name, and click *Continue*. 

== Create a BYOC cluster

. On the Home page, select your namespace, or create a new one.
+
Namespaces help you organize clusters and resources. For example, you can create namespaces for different teams or projects. A default namespace is created with every organization. When an organization has more than one namespace, you can select the namespace where you want to create a new cluster. 
. Click *Create cluster*, then click
+
Enter a cluster name, and select the provider (AWS), xref:deploy:deployment-option/cloud/regions.adocs[region], availability zone type (single AZ or multi AZ) and zones, xref:deploy:deployment-option/cloud/cloud-overview.adoc#cluster-tiers[tier], and Redpanda version.
+
[NOTE]
====
* If you plan to create a private network in your own VPC, select the region where your VPC is located.
* Three availability zones provide two backups in case one availability zone goes down.
====
+ 
Optionally, click *Advanced settings* to specify up to five key-value custom tags. After the cluster is created, the tags are applied to all AWS resources associated with this cluster. For more information, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconnect/latest/ug/tagging-restrictions.html[AWS documentation^].

. Click *Next*.
. On the Network page, enter the connection type: either *Public* or *Private*. For BYOC clusters, *Private* is best-practice.
** Your network name is used in the Redpanda UI to identify this network.
** For a CIDR range, choose one that does not overlap with your existing VPCs or your Redpanda network.
. Click *Next*.
. On the Deploy page, you need to prepare your environment, then run the `rpk plugin install` command in your environment.

As part of agent deployment, Redpanda assigns the permission required to run the agent. For details about these permissions, see xref:./security/authorization/cloud-iam-policies.adoc#aws-iam-policies[AWS IAM policies].
