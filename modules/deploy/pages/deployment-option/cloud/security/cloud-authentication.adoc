Redpanda Cloud ensures the highest level of authentication for both users and services.

== User authentication

Redpanda provides user authentication to your Redpanda organization through email or single sign-on. 

=== Email

Redpanda Cloud can authenticate users with emails and passwords. Passwords are hashed (a one-way function that makes the original value unrecoverable, and effectively encrypted) and salted at rest using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt[bcrypt^].

=== Single sign-on

include::shared:partial$feature-flag.adoc[]

Redpanda Cloud can authenticate users with single sign-on (SSO) to an OIDC-based identity provider (IdP). Redpanda integrates with any OIDC-compliant IdP that supports discovery, including Okta, Auth0, Microsoft Entra, and Active Directory Federation Services (AD-FS). After SSO is enabled for an organization, new users in that organization can authenticate with SSO. 

==== Integrate IdP

You must integrate your IdP with Redpanda Cloud to use SSO. On the *Users* page, users with admin permission see a *Single sign-on* tab and can add connections for up to two different IdPs. Enter the client ID, client secret, and discovery URI for the IdP. (See your IdP documentation for these values. The discovery URI may be called something different, like the well known URL or the `issuer_url`.) 

By default, the connection is added in a disabled state. Edit the connection to enable it. You can also choose to enable auto-enroll in the connection, which provides new users signing in from that IdP access to your Redpanda organization. When you enable auto-enroll, you select to assign a read, write, or admin role to users who log in with that IdP. 

Set up is different for most IdPs. For example, for Okta, follow the https://help.okta.com/en-us/Content/Topics/Apps/Apps_App_Integration_Wizard_OIDC.htm[Okta documentation^] to create an application within Okta for Redpanda. The Redpanda callback location (that is, the redirect location where Okta sends the user) is the following:

```
https://auth.prd.cloud.redpanda.com/login/callback
```

Okta provides the following fields required for SSO configuration on the *Users* page: `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `discoveryUrl`. The discovery URL for Okta generally looks like the following (where `an_id` could be “default”):

[pass]
```
https://<orgname>.okta.com/oauth2/<an_id>/.well-known/openid-configuration
``` 

NOTE: Deleting an SSO connection also deletes all users attached to it. 

== Service authentication

Each Redpanda Cloud data plane runs its own dedicated agent,
which authenticates and connects against the control plane over a single TLS 1.2
encrypted TCP connection.

Redpanda Cloud enables SASL/SCRAM authentication
over TLS 1.2 as well as xref:deploy:deployment-option/cloud/security/cloud-enable-mtls-kafka-api.adoc[mTLS] to authenticate Kafka clients connecting to Redpanda clusters over
the TCP endpoint or listener.

When connecting through Redpanda's HTTP Proxy, authentication is done through an
HTTP Basic Authentication header encrypted over TLS 1.2.

The following features use AWS and GCP xref:./authorization/cloud-authorization.adoc#iam-policies[IAM Policies] to generate
dynamic and short-lived credentials to interact with cloud provider APIs:

* Data plane agent
* Tiered Storage
* Redpanda Console
* Managed connectors

AWS and GCP IAM policies have constrained permissions so that each service can only
access or manage its own data plane-scoped resources, following the principle of
least privilege.
