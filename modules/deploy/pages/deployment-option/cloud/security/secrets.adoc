:description: Learn how Redpanda Cloud manages secrets.
:page-cloud: true

Redpanda Cloud uses _dynamic secrets_ through IAM roles. These
have policies defined by the actions and resources that a user (also
known as a principal) strictly needs, following the principle of least privilege.

Redpanda Cloud also uses _static secrets_, stored in either the
https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/[AWS Secrets Manager^] or
https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager[GCP Secret Manager^] services. Static
secrets managed through Redpanda Console never leave their corresponding
data plane account or network. They stay securely stored in AWS Secrets Manager or
GCP Secret Manager.
