= Network Design, Ports, and Flows
:description: Learn about Redpanda Cloud network design, including ports, and flows.
:page-cloud: true

Redpanda Cloud deploys two different types of networks: one for private Redpanda
clusters and another for public Redpanda clusters. By default, networks are always
laid out across multiple availability zones (AZs) to enable the creation of one or
many single and multi-AZ Redpanda clusters within them.

== Public Redpanda clusters

With public Redpanda clusters, TCP listeners are protected by SASL/SCRAM
(SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-512) authentication and encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2.

The following diagram shows the public subnet used by public Redpanda clusters.

== Private Redpanda clusters

Private Redpanda clusters are designed based on the following behaviors:

* There is proper network segmentation.
* All Redpanda services are only accessible from within the same VPC or through
VPC peering.
* The data plane agent is placed in public subnets and segmented away by
firewall rules from Redpanda services.

The following diagram shows the private subnet used by private Redpanda clusters.

== Network ports

Network ports are available for North-South, East-West, and South-North as follows.

=== North-South

The following table lists the network ports available to external clients within
each data plane. For private-only Redpanda clusters, access to these ports is
only possible through Redpanda Cloud network connections such as xref:deploy:deployment-option/cloud/vpc-peering.adoc[VPC Peering],
transit gateway attachments, or private links.

== AWS network services

Redpanda Cloud supports the following Amazon Web Services (AWS) network services.

* Time synchronization
+
To ensure time synchronization, Redpanda Cloud in AWS uses
the https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/introducing-the-amazon-time-sync-service/[Amazon Time Sync Service^],
a fleet of redundant satellite-connected and atomic reference clocks in AWS
regions.

* Domain Name System (DNS)
+
Redpanda Cloud creates a new DNS zone for each cluster in the control plane
and delegates its management exclusively to each cluster's data plane. In turn,
the data plane creates a hosted zone in Route 53, managing DNS records for
Redpanda services as needed. All interactions with Route 53 are controlled
by IAM policies targeted to the specific Route 53 resources managed by each data
plane, following the least privilege principle.

* Distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection
+
All Redpanda Cloud services publicly exposed in the control plane and data plane
are protected against the most common layer 3 and 4 DDoS attacks by
https://aws.amazon.com/shield/features/#AWS_Shield_Standard[AWS Shield Standard^],
with no latency impact.

* VPC peering
+
Redpanda Cloud supports configuring xref:deploy:deployment-option/cloud/vpc-peering.adoc[VPC peering] against
Redpanda Cloud networks, making them available to one or many private
clusters and allowing users to connect to those clusters without traversing the
public internet.
+
You can establish VPC peering connections between two VPCs with non-overlapping
network addresses. When creating a network intended for peering,
ensure that the specified network address range does not overlap with the network
address range of the destination VPC.
+
It is strongly recommended to reject all network traffic initiated from a Redpanda
Cloud network and only accept traffic from Kafka connectors that connect to
your internal data stores to retrieve or push data.

== GCP network services

Redpanda Cloud supports the following Google Cloud Platform (GCP) network services.

* Time synchronization
+
To ensure time synchronization, Redpanda Cloud in GCP uses https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/configure-ntp#linux-chrony[Google NTP Servers^],
a fleet of satellite-connected and atomic reference clocks.

* Domain Name System (DNS)
+
Redpanda Cloud creates a new DNS zone for each cluster in the control plane
and delegates its management exclusively to each cluster's data plane. In turn,
the data plane creates a managed zone in Cloud DNS, managing DNS records for
Redpanda services, as needed. All the interactions with Cloud DNS are
controlled by IAM policies targeted to the specific Cloud DNS resources managed
by each data plane, following the least privilege principle.

* VPC peering
+
Redpanda Cloud supports configuring xref:deploy:deployment-option/cloud/vpc-peering.adoc[VPC peering] against Redpanda Cloud networks,
making them available to one or many private Redpanda clusters and allowing
users to connect to those clusters without traversing the public internet.
+
You can establish VPC peering connections between two VPCs with non-overlapping
network addresses. When creating a network intended for peering,
ensure that the specified network address range does not overlap with the network
address range of the destination VPC.
+
It is strongly recommended to reject all network traffic initiated from a Redpanda
Cloud network and only accept traffic from Kafka connectors that connect to
your internal data stores to retrieve or push data.
