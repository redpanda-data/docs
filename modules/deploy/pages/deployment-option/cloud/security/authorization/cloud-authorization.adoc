:description: Learn how Redpanda Cloud uses IAM roles for authorization.
:page-cloud: true

There are two types of authorization in Redpanda Cloud:

* User authorization
+
User authorizations, managed by Kafka xref:manage:security/authorization.adoc#acls[ACLs],
grant users permission to perform specific types of operations on specific
resources (such as topics, groups, clusters, or transactional IDs).

* Agent authorization
+
When deploying an xref:deploy:deployment-option/cloud/cloud-overview.adoc#agent[agent] as part of BYOC cluster
provisioning, Redpanda Cloud automatically assigns IAM policies to that agent.
The IAM policy permissions granted to the agent provide it the authorization
required to fully manage Redpanda Cloud clusters in AWS or GCP.
+
IMPORTANT: IAM policies do not apply or act as deployment permissions, and there are no
explicit user actions associated with IAM policies. Rather, IAM policy
permissions apply to Redpanda Cloud agents _only_, and serve to provide Redpanda
agents access to AWS and GCP clusters so Redpanda brokers can communicate
with them.
