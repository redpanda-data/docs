= Monitor Redpanda Cloud
:description: Learn how to configure monitoring on your Dedicated or BYOC cluster to maintain system health and optimize performance.
:page-cloud: true
:env-cloud: true

You can configure monitoring on your Redpanda Dedicated or BYOC cluster to maintain system health and optimize performance. Redpanda Cloud exports metrics for all brokers and Kafka Connect workers from a single Prometheus endpoint. This endpoint can be found on the *Overview* page for your cluster, under *How to connect*. 

You can monitor Redpanda with Prometheus or with any other monitoring and alerting tool, such as Datadog, New Relic, Elastic Cloud, Google, or Azure.

[NOTE]
====
To maximize performance, Redpanda exports some metrics only when the underlying feature is in use. For example, a metric for consumer groups, xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc#redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_committed_offset[`redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_committed_offset`], is only exported when groups are registered.

== Configure Prometheus

To monitor a Dedicated or BYOC cluster in https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus^]:

. On the Redpanda Cloud *Overview* page for your cluster, under *How to connect*, click the *Prometheus* tab. 

. Click the copy icon for *Prometheus YAML* to copy the contents to your clipboard.

+
The YAML contains the Prometheus scrape target configuration, as well as authentication, for the cluster.
+
[,yaml]
----
- job_name: redpandaCloud-sample
  static_configs:
    - targets:
        - console-<id>.<identifier>.fmc.cloud.redpanda.com
  metrics_path: /api/cloud/prometheus/public_metrics
  basic_auth:
    username: prometheus
    password: "<prom_pass>"
  scheme: https
----

. Save this information to Prometheus, and observe in Prometheus that metrics from Redpanda endpoints are scraped.

== Configure Datadog

To monitor a Dedicated or BYOC cluster in https://www.datadoghq.com/[Datadog]:

. On the Redpanda Cloud *Overview* page for your cluster, under *How to connect*, click the *Prometheus* tab. 

. Click the copy icon for *Prometheus YAML* to find scrape target configuration, as well as authentication, for the cluster.

. In Datadog, define the `openmetrics_endpoint` URL for that monitored cluster. The integration configuration should look similar to the following:
+
[,yaml]
----
instances:
  # The endpoint to collect metrics about Polaris. Replace ORGANIZATION_NAME with the name of your organization.
  - openmetrics_endpoint: https://console-<id>.<identifier>.fmc.cloud.redpanda.com/api/cloud/prometheus/public_metrics
    use_openmetrics: true
    collect_counters_with_distributions: true

    auth_type: basic
    username: prom_user
    password: prom_pass
----

. Restart the Datadog agent. 

NOTE: Because the Prometheus endpoint in Redpanda Cloud aggregates metrics for all cluster services, only a single Datadog agent is required. The agent must run in a container in your own container infrastructure. Redpanda does not support launching this container inside a Dedicated or BYOC Kubernetes cluster. For more information, see the https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/redpanda/?tab=host[Datadog documentation^] and https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-extras/tree/master/redpanda[Redpanda Datadog integration^].

== Use Redpanda monitoring examples

For hands-on learning, Redpanda provides a repository with examples of monitoring Redpanda with Prometheus and Grafana: https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability/tree/main/cloud[redpanda-data/observability^].

image::https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability/blob/main/docs/images/Ops%20Dashboard.png?raw=true[Example Redpanda Ops Dashboard^]

It includes https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability#grafana-dashboards[example Grafana dashboards^] and a https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability#sandbox-environment[sandbox environment^] in which you launch a Dockerized Redpanda cluster and create a custom workload to monitor with dashboards.
