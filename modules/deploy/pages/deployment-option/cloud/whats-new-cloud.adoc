=== Schema Registry management

In the Redpanda Console UI, you can perform Schema Registry operations, such as registering a schema, creating a new version of it, and configuring compatibility. The **Schema Registry** tab lists verified schemas, including their serialization format and versions. Select an individual schema to see which topics it applies to.

=== Maintenance windows

By default, Redpanda Cloud upgrades take place anytime on Tuesdays. Optionally, you can select a window of specific hours when Redpanda can apply updates to your cluster. Updates may start at any time during that window.
