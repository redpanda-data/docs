== November 2023

==== Optimized BYOC tiers support ARM-based AWS Graviton processors

BYOC clusters now support ARM-based AWS Graviton processors on Amazon EC2. This allows decreased VM costs and increased partition support.

==== Iceberg Sink connector

With the xref:deploy:deployment-option/cloud/managed-connectors/create-iceberg-sink-connector.adoc[managed connector for Apache Iceberg], you can write data into Iceberg tables. This enables integration with the data lake ecosystem and efficient data management for complex analytics.

==== Schema Registry management

In the Redpanda Console UI, you can perform Schema Registry operations, such as registering a schema, creating a new version of it, and configuring compatibility. The **Schema Registry** page lists verified schemas, including their serialization format and versions. Select an individual schema to see which topics it applies to.

==== Maintenance windows

With customizable maintenance windows, you have greater flexibility to plan upgrades to your cluster. By default, all Redpanda Cloud upgrades take place anytime on Tuesdays. Optionally, on the **Cluster settings** page, you can select a window of specific off-hours for your business for Redpanda to apply updates. Updates may start at any time during that window.
