= Cloud API Error and Status Codes
:description: Error and status codes you might encounter when using the Cloud API.
:page-cloud: true
:page-api: cloud
:page-beta: true

The Redpanda Cloud API uses HTTP codes to indicate the status of a request. The response payload also includes <<error-codes-and-details,additional error codes and descriptions>> that provide more detail about why an operation failed.

Example request:

```
curl https://api.redpanda.com/clusters/v1beta2 | jq
```

Example response:

```
{
  "code": "UNAUTHENTICATED",
  "message": "Bearer token is not present",
  "details": [
    {
      "@type": "google.rpc.ErrorInfo",
      "reason": "REASON_NO_TOKEN",
      "domain": "redpanda.com/controlplane",
      "metadata": {}
    },
    {
      "@type": "google.rpc.Help",
      "links": [
        {
          "description": "Please ensure you have a valid token to authenticate against the API. If you don't have a token, create a client and follow the instructions to request a token.",
          "url": "https://cloud.redpanda.com/clients"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

== HTTP response codes

A `2xx` HTTP status code indicates that a request is successful:

- `200` OK. Request was successful.
- `201` Created. The requested resource was successfully created.
- `202` Accepted. The request is accepted and is processing, for example for a long-running operation.
- `204` No content. Usually returned by a successful delete request.

The following HTTP status codes indicate errors:

- `400` Bad request. There is an error that must be fixed in the request, such as an invalid parameter value. Attempt the request again after it is fixed.
- `401` Unauthenticated. The authentication credentials are missing or invalid.
- `404` Not found. The specified resource was not found.
- `409` Conflict. Usually returned when the resource to be created by the request already exists.
- `500` Internal server error. Reach out to Redpanda support.

== Error codes and details

The response payload contains additional error details: a https://grpc.io/docs/guides/status-codes/[gRPC status code^], and an error message that contains further details. 

The Control Plane API returns a set of possible error codes that are mostly distinct from the possible Data Plane API error codes.
