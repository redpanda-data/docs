= Create a PostgreSQL (Debezium) Source Connector
:description: Use the Redpanda Cloud UI to create a PostgreSQL (Debezium) Source Connector.
:page-cloud: true
:page-categories: Deployment, Integration

You can use a PostgreSQL (Debezium) Source connector to import updates to Redpanda from PostgreSQL.

== Prerequisites

Before you can create a PostgreSQL (Debezium) Source connector in the Redpanda Cloud, you
must:

* https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/postgresql.html#postgresql-security[Make the PostgreSQL (Debezium) database accessible^]
from connectors instance.
* https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/postgresql.html#postgresql-permissions[Create a PostgreSQL (Debezium) user^]
with the necessary permissions.

== Limitations

The PostgreSQL (Debezium) Source connector has the following limitations:

* Only `JSON`, `CloudEvents` or `AVRO` formats can be used for a Kafka message key and value format.
* PostgreSQL (Debezium) connector can work with only a single task at a time.

== Create a PostgreSQL (Debezium) Source connector

To create the PostgreSQL (Debezium) Source connector:

. In Redpanda Cloud, click *Connectors* in the navigation menu, and then
click *Create Connector*.
. Select *Import from PostgreSQL (Debezium)*.
. On the *Create Connector* page, specify the following required connector
configuration options:
+
|===
| Property name | Property key | Description

| `Topic prefix`
| `topic.prefix`
| A topic prefix that identifies and provides a namespace for the particular database server/cluster that is capturing changes. The topic prefix should be unique across all other connectors because it is used as a prefix for all Kafka topic names that receive events emitted by this connector. Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, dots, and underscores are accepted.

| `Hostname`
| `database.hostname`
| A resolvable hostname or IP address of the PostgreSQL database server.

| `Port`
| `database.port`
| Integer port number of the PostgreSQL database server.

| `User`
| `database.user`
| Name of the PostgreSQL user to be used when connecting to the PostgreSQL database.

| `Password`
| `database.password`
| The password of the PostgreSQL database user who will be connecting to the PostgreSQL database.

| `Database`
| `database.dbname`
| The name of the database from which the connector will import changes.

| `SSL mode`
| `database.sslmode`
| Specifies whether to use an encrypted connection to the PostgreSQL server. Select `disable` to use an unencrypted connection. Select `require` to use a secure, or encrypted connection. If a secure connection cannot be established when `required` is selected, then the connector fails.

| `Kafka message key format`
| `key.converter`
| Format of the key in the Redpanda topic.

| `Message key JSON contains schema`
| `key.converter.schemas.enable`
| Enable to specify that the message key contains schema in the schema field.

| `Kafka message value format`
| `value.converter`
| Format of the value in the Redpanda topic.

| `Message value JSON contains schema`
| `value.converter.schemas.enable`
| Enable to specify that the message value contains schema in the schema field.

| `Connector name`
| `name`
| Globally-unique name to use for this connector.
|===

. Click *Next*. Review the connector properties specified, then click *Create*.

== Map data

Use the appropriate key or value converter (input data format) for your data as follows:

* Use `Include Schemas`, `Include Tables` and `Include Columns` properties to define
lists of columns, tables, and schemas to read from. Alternatively, use `Exclude Schemas`,
`Exclude Tables`, and `Exclude Columns` to define lists of columns, tables, and
schemas to exclude from sources list.
* Use only `JSON` (`org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter`), `AVRO` (`io.confluent.connect.avro.AvroConverter`)
and `CloudEvents` (`io.debezium.converters.CloudEventsConverter`) formats for the Kafka message key and value format.

== Test the connection

After the connector is created:

. Open Redpanda Console, click the *Topics* tab and select a topic.
Check to check to confirm that it contains data migrated from PostgreSQL.
Alternatively, use the `rpk consume` to check the topic.
. Click the *Connectors* tab to confirm no issues have been reported for the
connector.

== Troubleshoot

If the connector configuration is invalid, an error appears upon clicking *Finish*.
Select *Show Logs* to view error details.

Additional errors and corrective actions follow.

|===
| Message | Action

| *Missing tables or topics*
| The Debezium connector replicates tables one by one. Wait for other tables to be replicated. If the database is quite large, then replication takes longer to complete.

| *non-existing-db*
| Make sure the provided database name in `Database` is correct, and that the database exists.

| *The connection attempt failed / Connection to postgres:9999 refused*
| Check to make sure that `hostname` and `port` are correct.

| *Password authentication failed for user*
| Make sure that the `User` and `Password` credentials are valid.

| *The Plugin name value is invalid*
| Make sure that `Plugin` contains a https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/postgresql.html#postgresql-property-plugin-name[valid value^], either `decoderbufs` or `pgoutput`.

| *Postgres server `wal_level` property is `replica`*
| Specify `wal_level` as `logical` for your database.

| *RecordTooLargeException: The message is 1050766 bytes when serialized, which is larger than 1048576, the value of the max.request.size configuration.*
| Increase the max request size to unblock the connector and allow large messages to pass: `"producer.override.max.request.size": "209715200".` The connector may be reaching memory limits and failing if the amount of data to pass or your messages are too large.
