= Create a MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint Connector
:description: Use the Redpanda Cloud UI to create a MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint Connector.
:page-cloud: true
:page-categories: Deployment, Integration

You can use the MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint connector to import consumer group offsets
from other Kafka clusters.

== Prerequisites

* The external Kafka cluster is accessible.
* A service account with read-only access to the external cluster is available.
* The Kafka cluster topics connector is running for the same source cluster, with a matching configuration.

== Create a MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint connector

To create the MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint connector:

. In Redpanda Cloud, click *Connectors* in the navigation menu, and then
click *Create Connector*.
. Select *Import from Kafka cluster offsets*.
. On the *Create Connector* page, specify the following required connector
configuration options:
+
|===
| Property name | Property key | Description

| `Topics to replicate`
| `topics`
| Comma-separated topic names and regexes you want to replicate.

| `Source cluster broker list`
| `source.cluster.bootstrap.servers`
| A comma-separated list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of all servers regardless of which servers are specified here for bootstrapping.

| `Source cluster security protocol`
| `source.cluster.security.protocol`
| The protocol used to communicate with source brokers. The default is `PLAINTEXT`.

| `Source cluster SASL mechanism`
| `source.cluster.sasl.mechanism`
| SASL mechanism used for connections to source cluster. Default is `PLAIN`.

| `Source cluster SASL username`
| `source.cluster.sasl.username`
| SASL username used for connections to source cluster.

| `Source cluster SASL password`
| `source.cluster.sasl.password`
| SASL password used for connections to source cluster.

| `Groups`
| `groups`
| Consumer groups to replicate. Supports comma-separated group IDs and regexes.

| `Connector name`
| `name`
| Globally-unique name to use for this connector.
|===

. Click *Next*. Review the connector properties specified, then click *Create*.

=== Advanced MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint connector configuration

In most instances, the preceding basic configuration properties are sufficient.
If you require additional property settings, then specify any of the following
_optional_ advanced connector configuration properties by selecting *Show advanced options*
on the *Create Connector* page:

|===
| Property name | Property key | Description

| `Source cluster SSL custom certificate`
| `source.cluster.ssl.truststore.certificates`
| Trusted certificates in the PEM format.

| `Source cluster SSL keystore key`
| `source.cluster.ssl.keystore.key`
| Private key in the PEM format.

| `Source cluster SSL keystore certificate chain`
| `source.cluster.ssl.keystore.certificate.chain`
| Certificate chain in the PEM format.

| `Topics exclude`
| `topics.exclude`
| Excluded topics. Supports comma-separated topic names and regexes.

| `Source cluster alias`
| `source.cluster.alias`
| When using DefaultReplicationPolicy, topic names will be prefixed with it.

| `Replication policy class`
| `replication.policy.class`
| Class that defines the remote topic naming convention. Use IdentityReplicationPolicy to preserve topic names. DefaultReplicationPolicy prefixes the topic with the source cluster alias.

| `Emit checkpoints interval seconds`
| `emit.checkpoints.interval.seconds`
| Frequency of checkpoints. The default is `60`.

| `Sync group offsets enabled`
| `sync.group.offsets.enabled`
| Specifies whether or not to periodically write the translated offsets to the __consumer_offsets topic in the target cluster, as long as no active consumers in that group are connected to the target cluster.

| `Sync group offsets interval seconds`
| `sync.group.offsets.interval.seconds`
| Frequency of consumer group offset sync. The default is `60`.

| `Refresh groups interval seconds`
| `refresh.groups.interval.seconds`
| Frequency of group refreshes. The default is `600`.

| `Offset-Syncs topic location`
| `offset-syncs.topic.location`
| The location (`source` or `target`) of the offset-syncs topic. The default is `source`.

| `Checkpoints topic replication factor`
| `checkpoints.topic.replication.factor`
| Replication factor for checkpoints topic. The default is `-1`.
|===

== Test the connection

After the connector is created:

* Ensure that there are no errors in logs and in Redpanda Console.
* Wait for the Kafka cluster topics connector to catch up. Then check to confirm that the consumer groups are replicated.

== Troubleshoot

Most MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint connector issues are reported as a failed task at the time of creation.
Select *Show Logs* to view error details.

| Message | Action

| *Connection to node -1 (/127.0.0.1:9092) could not be established. Broker may not be available. / LOGS: Timed out while checking for or creating topic 'mm2-offset-syncs.target.internal'. This could indicate a connectivity issue / TimeoutException: Timed out waiting for a node assignment*
| Make sure broker URLs are correct and that the source cluster security protocol is correct.

| *SaslAuthenticationException: SASL authentication failed: security: Invalid credentials*
| Check to confirm that the username and password specified are correct.

| *java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No serviceName defined in either JAAS or Kafka config*
| Check to confirm that the username and password specified are correct.

| *Client SASL mechanism 'PLAIN' not enabled in the server, enabled mechanisms are [SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-512]*
| Check to confirm that the respective `Source cluster SASL mechanism` is correct.

| *SaslAuthenticationException: SASL authentication failed: security: Invalid credentials*
| Make sure the respective `Source cluster SASL mechanism` is correct (for example, SCRAM-SHA-256 instead of SCRAM-SHA-512).

| *terminated during authentication. This may happen due to any of the following reasons: (1) Authentication failed due to invalid credentials with brokers older than 1.0.0, (2) Firewall blocking Kafka TLS traffic (eg it may only allow HTTPS traffic), (3) Transient network issue*
| Enable the SSL using `Source cluster security protocol` (specify `SSL` or `SASL_SSL`).
