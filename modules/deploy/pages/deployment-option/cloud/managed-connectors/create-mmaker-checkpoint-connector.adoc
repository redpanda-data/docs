= Create a MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint Connector
:description: Use the Redpanda Cloud UI to create a MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint Connector.
:page-cloud: true

You can use the MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint connector to import consumer group offsets
from other Kafka clusters.

== Prerequisites

* The external Kafka cluster is accessible.
* A service account with read-only access to the external cluster is available.
* The Kafka cluster topics connector is running for the same source cluster, with a matching configuration.

== Limitations

The MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint connector does not migrate consumer group offsets that are lower than the highest
offsets synced by the MirrorMaker2 Source connector by the time the MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint connector is started.

== Create a MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint connector

To create the MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint connector:

. In Redpanda Cloud, click *Connectors* in the navigation menu, and then
click *Create Connector*.
. Select *Import from Kafka cluster offsets*.
. On the *Create Connector* page, specify the following required connector
configuration options:
+
|===
| Property name | Property key | Description

| `Topics to replicate`
| `topics`
| Comma-separated topic names and regexes you want to replicate.

| `Source cluster broker list`
| `source.cluster.bootstrap.servers`
| A comma-separated list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of all servers regardless of which servers are specified here for bootstrapping.

| `Source cluster security protocol`
| `source.cluster.security.protocol`
| The protocol used to communicate with source brokers. The default is `PLAINTEXT`.

| `Source cluster SASL mechanism`
| `source.cluster.sasl.mechanism`
| SASL mechanism used for connections to source cluster. Default is `PLAIN`.

| `Source cluster SASL username`
| `source.cluster.sasl.username`
| SASL username used for connections to source cluster.

| `Source cluster SASL password`
| `source.cluster.sasl.password`
| SASL password used for connections to source cluster.

| `Groups`
| `groups`
| Consumer groups to replicate. Supports comma-separated group IDs and regexes.

| `Connector name`
| `name`
| Globally-unique name to use for this connector.
|===

. Click *Next*. Review the connector properties specified, then click *Create*.

=== Advanced MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint connector configuration

In most instances, the preceding basic configuration properties are sufficient.
If you require additional property settings, then specify any of the following
_optional_ advanced connector configuration properties by selecting *Show advanced options*
on the *Create Connector* page:

|===
| Property name | Property key | Description

| `Source cluster SSL custom certificate`
| `source.cluster.ssl.truststore.certificates`
| Trusted certificates in the PEM format.

| `Source cluster SSL keystore key`
| `source.cluster.ssl.keystore.key`
| Private key in the PEM format.

| `Source cluster SSL keystore certificate chain`
| `source.cluster.ssl.keystore.certificate.chain`
| Certificate chain in the PEM format.

| `Topics exclude`
| `topics.exclude`
| Excluded topics. Supports comma-separated topic names and regexes.

| `Source cluster alias`
| `source.cluster.alias`
| When using DefaultReplicationPolicy, topic names will be prefixed with it.

| `Replication policy class`
| `replication.policy.class`
| Class that defines the remote topic naming convention. Use IdentityReplicationPolicy to preserve topic names. DefaultReplicationPolicy prefixes the topic with the source cluster alias.

| `Emit checkpoints interval seconds`
| `emit.checkpoints.interval.seconds`
| Frequency of checkpoints. The default is `60`.

| `Sync group offsets enabled`
| `sync.group.offsets.enabled`
| Specifies whether or not to periodically write the translated offsets to the __consumer_offsets topic in the target cluster, as long as no active consumers in that group are connected to the target cluster.

| `Sync group offsets interval seconds`
| `sync.group.offsets.interval.seconds`
| Frequency of consumer group offset sync. The default is `60`.

| `Refresh groups interval seconds`
| `refresh.groups.interval.seconds`
| Frequency of group refreshes. The default is `600`.

| `Offset-Syncs topic location`
| `offset-syncs.topic.location`
| The location (`source` or `target`) of the offset-syncs topic. The default is `source`.

| `Checkpoints topic replication factor`
| `checkpoints.topic.replication.factor`
| Replication factor for checkpoints topic. The default is `-1`.
|===

== Test the connection

After the connector is created:

* Ensure that there are no errors in logs and in Redpanda Console.
* Wait for the Kafka cluster topics connector to catch up. Then check to confirm that the consumer groups are replicated.

== Use the Connectors API
When using the Connectors API, instead of specifying a value for `source.cluster.sasl.username` and `source.cluster.sasl.password`, 
you can specify a value for `source.cluster.sasl.jaas.config`.

== Troubleshoot

Most MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint connector issues are reported as a failed task at the time of creation.
Select *Show Logs* to view error details.

| Message | Action

| *Connection to node -1 (/127.0.0.1:9092) could not be established. Broker may not be available. / LOGS: Timed out while checking for or creating topic 'mm2-offset-syncs.target.internal'. This could indicate a connectivity issue / TimeoutException: Timed out waiting for a node assignment*
| Make sure broker URLs are correct and that the source cluster security protocol is correct.

| *SaslAuthenticationException: SASL authentication failed: security: Invalid credentials*
| Check to confirm that the username and password specified are correct.

| *java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No serviceName defined in either JAAS or Kafka config*
| Check to confirm that the username and password specified are correct.

| *Client SASL mechanism 'PLAIN' not enabled in the server, enabled mechanisms are [SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-512]*
| Check to confirm that the respective `Source cluster SASL mechanism` is correct.

| *SaslAuthenticationException: SASL authentication failed: security: Invalid credentials*
| Make sure the respective `Source cluster SASL mechanism` is correct (for example, SCRAM-SHA-256 instead of SCRAM-SHA-512).

| *terminated during authentication. This may happen due to any of the following reasons: (1) Authentication failed due to invalid credentials with brokers older than 1.0.0, (2) Firewall blocking Kafka TLS traffic (eg it may only allow HTTPS traffic), (3) Transient network issue*
| Enable the SSL using `Source cluster security protocol` (specify `SSL` or `SASL_SSL`).
