= TimestampRouter
:description: TimestampRouter Single Message Transform for a connector to update the record's topic field.
:page-cloud: true

The TimestampRouter SMT updates the record's topic field as a function of the original topic value and the record timestamp. This is mainly useful for sink connectors, since the topic field is often used to determine the equivalent entity name in the destination system (e.g. database table or search index name).

NOTE: TimestampRouter SMT should be used with sink connectors only.
