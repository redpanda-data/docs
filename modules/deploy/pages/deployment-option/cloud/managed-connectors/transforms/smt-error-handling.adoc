== Error handling

By default `Error tolerance` is set to `NONE`, so the connector will fail in case of any exceptions (notably data parsing or data processing errors). To avoid connector crashing in case of data issues, set `Error tolerance` to `ALL` and specify `Dead Letter Queue Topic Name`, as a place where failed messages are redirected.
