:description: How to set Filter Single Message Transform for a connector to filter out records matching a particular predicate.
:page-cloud: true

Filter SMT drops all records, filtering them from subsequent transformations in the chain. This is intended to be used conditionally to filter out records matching (or not matching) a particular Predicate.

== Configuration

|=== 
| Property key | Description

| `predicate`
| Name of predicate filtering records.

|===

== Example

Sample configuration:

----
"transforms": "Filter",
"transforms.Filter.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.Filter",
"transforms.Filter.predicate": "IsMyTopic",
"predicates": "IsMyTopic",
"predicates.IsMyTopic.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.predicates.TopicNameMatches",
"predicates.IsMyTopic.pattern": "my-topic"
----

== Predicates

Managed Connectors support the following predicates:

=== TopicNameMatches
`org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.predicates.TopicNameMatches` - A predicate which is true for records with a topic name that matches the configured regular expression.

|=== 
| Property key | Description

| `pattern`
| A Java regular expression for matching against the name of a record's topic.

|===

=== HasHeaderKey

`org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.predicates.HasHeaderKey` - A predicate which is true for records with at least one header with the configured name.

|=== 
| Property key | Description

| `name`
| The header name.
