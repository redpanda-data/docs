= Create a Snowflake Sink Connector
:description: Use the Redpanda Cloud UI to create a Snowflake Sink Connector.
:page-cloud: true

You can use the Snowflake Sink connector to ingest and store Redpanda structured data into a
Snowflake database for analytics and decision-making.

== Prerequisites

Before you can create a Snowflake Sink connector in the Redpanda Cloud, you
must:

. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/kafka-connector-install#creating-a-role-to-use-the-kafka-connector[Create a role^]
for use by Kafka Connect.
. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth#configuring-key-pair-authentication[Create a key pair^]
for authentication.
. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/getting-started-tutorial-create-objects#creating-a-database[Create a database^]
to hold the data you intend to stream from Redpanda Cloud messages.

== Limitations

Refer to the https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/kafka-connector-overview#kafka-connector-limitations[Snowflake Kafka Connector Limitations^]
documentation for details.

== Create a Snowflake Sink connector

To create a Snowflake Sink connector:

. In Redpanda Cloud, click *Connectors* in the navigation menu, and then
click *Create Connector*.
. Select *Export to Snowflake*.
. On the *Create Connector* page, specify the following required connector configuration options:
+
|===
| Property name | Property key | Description

| `Topics to export`
| `topics`
| A comma-separated list of the cluster topics you want to export to Snowflake.

| `Topics regex`
| `topics.regex`
| Java regular expression of topics to replicate. For example: specify `.*` to replicate all available topics in the cluster. Applicable only when **Use regular expressions** is selected.

| `Snowflake URL name`
| `snowflake.url.name`
| The Snowflake URL to be used for the connection.

| `Snowflake database name`
| `snowflake.database.name`
| The Snowflake database name to be used for the exported data.

| `Snowflake user name`
| `snowflake.user.name`
| The name of the user who created the key pair.

| `Snowflake private key`
| `snowflake.private.key`
| The private key name for the Snowflake user.

| `Snowflake private key passphrase`
| `snowflake.private.key.passphrase`
| (_Optional_) If created and encrypted, the passphrase of the private key.

| `Snowflake role name`
| `snowflake.role.name`
| The name of the role created in <<Prerequisites>>.

| `Kafka message value format`
| `value.converter`
| The format of the value in the Kafka topic. The default is `SNOWFLAKE_JSON`.

| `Max Tasks`
| `tasks.max`
| Maximum number of tasks to use for this connector. The default is `1`. Each task replicates exclusive set of partitions assigned to it.

| `Connector name`
| `name`
| Globally-unique name to use for this connector.
|===

. Click *Next*. Review the connector properties specified, then click *Create*.

=== Advanced Snowflake Sink connector configuration

In most instances, the preceding basic configuration properties are sufficient.
If you require additional property settings, then specify any of the following
_optional_ advanced connector configuration properties by selecting *Show advanced options*
on the *Create Connector* page:

|===
| Property name | Property key | Description

| `Snowflake schema name`
| `snowflake.schema.name`
| The Snowflake database schema name. The default is `PUBLIC`.

| `Snowflake ingestion method`
| `snowflake.ingestion.method`
| The default, `SNOWPIPE`, allows for structured data, while `SNOWPIPE_STREAMING` is lower latency option.

| `Snowflake topic2table map`
| `snowflake.topic2table.map`
| (_Optional_) Map of topics to tables. Format is comma-separated tuples. For example, `<topic-1>:<table-1>,<topic-2>:<table-2>`.

| `Buffer count records`
| `buffer.count.records`
| Number of records buffered in memory per partition before triggering Snowflake ingestion. Default is 10000.

| `Buffer flush time`
| `buffer.flush.time`
| The time in seconds to flush cached data. Default is 120.

| `Buffer size bytes`
| `buffer.size.bytes`
| Cumulative size of records buffered in memory per partition before triggering Snowflake ingestion. Default is 5000000.

| `Error tolerance`
| `errors.tolerance`
| Error tolerance response during connector operation. Default value is `none` and signals that any error will result in an immediate connector task failure. Value of `all` changes the behavior to skip over problematic records.

| `Dead letter queue topic name`
| `errors.deadletterqueue.topic.name`
| The name of the topic to be used as the dead letter queue (DLQ) for messages that result in an error when processed by this sink connector, its transformations, or converters. The topic name is blank by default, which means that no messages are recorded in the DLQ.

| `Dead letter queue topic replication factor`
| `errors.deadletterqueue.topic .replication.factor`
| Replication factor used to create the dead letter queue topic when it doesn't already exist.

| `Enable error context headers`
| `errors.deadletterqueue.context .headers.enable`
| When `true`, adds a header containing error context to the messages written to the dead letter queue. To avoid clashing with headers from the original record, all error context header keys, start with `__connect.errors`.
|===

== Map data

Use the appropriate key or value converter (input data format) for your data as follows:

* `JSON` formatted records should use `SNOWFLAKE_JSON` (`com.snowflake.kafka.connector.records.SnowflakeJsonConverter`).
* `AVRO` formatted records that use Kafka's Schema Registry Service should use `SNOWFLAKE_AVRO` (`com.snowflake.kafka.connector.records.SnowflakeAvroConverter`).
* `AVRO` formatted records that contain the schema (and therefore do not need Kafka's Schema Registry Service) should use `SNOWFLAKE_AVRO_WITHOUT_SCHEMA_REGISTRY` (`com.snowflake.kafka.connector.records.SnowflakeAvroConverterWithoutSchemaRegistry`).
* Plain text formatted records should use `STRING` (`org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter`).

== Test the connection

After the connector is created, verify in your Snowflake worksheet that your table
is populated:

----
SELECT * FROM TEST.PUBLIC.TABLE_NAME;
----

It may take a couple of minutes for the records to be visible in Snowflake.

== Troubleshoot

After submitting the connector for creation in Redpanda Console, the
Snowflake Sink connector attempts to authenticate to the Snowflake database to validate
the configuration. This validation must be successful before the connector is
created. It can take up 10 seconds or more to respond.
If the connector fails, check the error message or select *Show Logs* to view error details.

Additional errors and corrective actions follow.

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|Message |Action

|*snowflake.url.name is not a valid snowflake url*
|Check to make sure `Snowflake URL name` contains a valid Snowflake URL.

|*snowflake.user.name: Cannot connect to Snowflake*
|Check to make sure `Snowflake user name` contains a valid Snowflake user.

|*snowflake.private.key must be a valid PEM RSA private key / java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Last encoded character (before the padding, if any) is a valid base 64 alphabet but not a possible value. Expect the discarded bits to be zero*.
|`Snowflake private key` is invalid. Provide a valid key.

|*snowflake.database.name+ database does not exist*
|Specify a valid database name in `snowflake.database.name`.

|*Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed*
|Snowflake error that can have several causes: an invalid role is being used, there is no existing Snowflake table, or an incorrect schema name is specified. Verify that the connector configuration and Snowflake settings are valid.

|*Config:value.converter has provided value:com.snowflake.kafka.connector.records.SnowflakeJsonConverter. If ingestionMethod is:snowpipe_streaming, Snowflake Custom Converters are not allowed.*
|Use `STRING` for the `Kafka message value format`.
