:page-aliases: cloud:managed-connectors/create-s3-sink-connector.adoc
:page-cloud: true

The Amazon S3 Sink connector exports Apache Kafka messages to files in AWS S3 buckets.

== Prerequisites

Before you can create an AWS S3 sink connector in the Redpanda Cloud, you must complete these tasks:

. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-creating.html[Create an AWS account^].
. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html[Create an S3 bucket^] that you will send data to.
. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html[Create an IAM user^] that will be used to connect to the S3 service.
. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.html[Attach the following policy^] to the user, replacing `bucket-name` with the name you specified in step 2.

. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[Create access keys^] for the user created in step 3.
. Copy the access key ID and the secret access key. You will need them to configure the connector.

== Limitations

* You can use only the `STRING` and `BYTES` input formats for `CSV` output format.
* You can use only the `PARQUET` format when your messages contain schema.

== Create an AWS S3 Sink connector

To create the AWS S3 Sink connector:

. In Redpanda Cloud, click *Connectors* in the navigation menu, and then
click *Create Connector*.
. Select *Export to S3*.
. On the *Create Connector* page, specify the following required connector configuration options:
+
|===
| Property name | Property key | Description

| `Topics to export`
| `topics`
| Comma-separated list of the cluster topics whose records will be exported to the S3 bucket.

| `Topics regex`
| `topics.regex`
| Java regular expression of topics to replicate. For example: specify `.*` to replicate all available topics in the cluster. Applicable only when **Use regular expressions** is selected.

| `AWS access key ID`
| `aws.access.key.id`
| Enter the AWS access key ID.

| `AWS secret access key`
| `aws.secret.access.key`
| Enter the AWS secret access key.

|===

. Click *Next*. Review the connector properties specified, then click *Create*.

=== Advanced AWS S3 Sink connector configuration

In most instances, the preceding basic configuration properties are sufficient.
If you require additional property settings, then specify any of the following
_optional_ advanced connector configuration properties by selecting *Show advanced options*
on the *Create Connector* page:

|===
| Property name | Property key | Description

| `File name template`
| `file.name.template`
a| The template for file names on S3. Supports `{{ variable }}` placeholders for substituting variables. Supported placeholders are:

- `topic`
- `partition`
- `start_offset` (the offset of the first record in the file)
- `timestamp`
- `key` (when used, other placeholders are not substituted)

| `File name prefix`
| `file.name.prefix`
| The prefix to be added to the name of each file put in S3.

| `Output fields`
| `format.output.fields`
| Fields to place into output files. Supported values are: 'key', 'value', 'offset', 'timestamp', and 'headers'.

| `Value field encoding`
| `format.output.fields.value.encoding`
| The type of encoding to be used for the value field. Supported values are: 'none' and 'base64'.

| `Envelope for primitives`
| `format.output.envelope`
| Specifies whether or not to enable additional JSON object wrapping of the actual value.

| `Output file compression`
| `file.compression.type`
| The compression type to be used for files put into S3. Supported values are: 'none' (default), 'gzip', 'snappy', and 'zstd'.

| `Max records per file`
| `file.max.records`
| The maximum number of records to put in a single file. Must be a non-negative number. 0 is interpreted as "unlimited", which is the default. In this case files are only flushed after `file.flush.interval.ms`.

| `File flush interval milliseconds`
| `file.flush.interval.ms`
| The time interval to periodically flush files and commit offsets. Value specified must be a non-negative number. Default is 60 seconds. 0 indicates that it is disabled. In this case, files are only flushed after reaching `file.max.records` record size.

| `AWS S3 bucket check`
| `aws.s3.bucket.check`
| If set to `true` (default), the connector will attempt to put a test file to the S3 bucket to validate access.

| `AWS S3 part size bytes`
| `s3.part.size`
| The part size in S3 multi-part uploads in bytes. Maximum is 2147483647 (2GB) and default is 5242880 (5MB).

| `S3 retry backoff`
| `aws.s3.backoff.delay.ms`
| S3 default base sleep time (in milliseconds) for non-throttled exceptions. Default is 100.

| `S3 maximum back-off`
| `aws.s3.backoff.max.delay.ms`
| S3 maximum back-off time (in milliseconds) before retrying a request. Default is 20000.

| `S3 max retries`
| `aws.s3.backoff.max.retries`
| Maximum retry limit (if the value is greater than 30, there can be integer overflow issues during delay calculation). Default is 3.

| `Error tolerance`
| `errors.tolerance`
| Error tolerance response during connector operation. Default value is `none` and signals that any error will result in an immediate connector task failure. Value of `all` changes the behavior to skip over problematic records.

| `Dead letter queue topic name`
| `errors.deadletterqueue.topic.name`
| The name of the topic to be used as the dead letter queue (DLQ) for messages that result in an error when processed by this sink connector, its transformations, or converters. The topic name is blank by default, which means that no messages are recorded in the DLQ.

| `Dead letter queue topic replication factor`
| `errors.deadletterqueue.topic .replication.factor`
| Replication factor used to create the dead letter queue topic when it doesn't already exist.

| `Enable error context headers`
| `errors.deadletterqueue.context .headers.enable`
| When `true`, adds a header containing error context to the messages written to the dead letter queue. To avoid clashing with headers from the original record, all error context header keys, start with `__connect.errors`.
|===

== Map data

Use the appropriate key or value converter (input data format) for your data as follows:

* `JSON` (`org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter`) when your messages are JSON-encoded.
Select `Message JSON contains schema`, with the `schema` and `payload` fields.
* `AVRO` (`io.confluent.connect.avro.AvroConverter`) when your messages contain AVRO-encoded messages,
with schema stored in the Schema Registry.
* `STRING` (`org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter`) when your messages contain textual data.
* `BYTES` (`org.apache.kafka.connect.converters.ByteArrayConverter`) when your messages contain arbitrary data.

You can also select the output data format for your S3 files as follows:

* `CSV` to produce data in the `CSV` format. For `CSV` only, you can set `STRING` and `BYTES` input formats.
* `JSON` to produce data in the `JSON` format as an array of record objects.
* `JSONL` to produce data in the `JSON` format, each message as a separate JSON, one per line.
* `PARQUET` to produce data in the `PARQUET` format when your messages contain schema.
* `AVRO` to produce data in the `AVRO` format when your messages contain schema.

== Test the connection

After the connector is created, test the connection by writing to one of your
topics, then checking the contents of the S3 bucket in the AWS management console.
Files should appear after the file flush interval (default is 60 seconds).

== Troubleshoot

If there are any connection issues, an error message is returned. Depending on
the `AWS S3 bucket check` property value, the error results in a failed connector
(`AWS S3 bucket check = true`) or a failed task (`AWS S3 bucket check = false`).
Select *Show Logs* to view error details.

Additional errors and corrective actions follow.

|===
| Message | Action

| *The AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records*
| `AWS access key ID` is invalid. Check to confirm that a valid existing AWS access key is specified.

| *The authorization header is malformed; the region us-east-1 is wrong; expecting us-east-2*
| The selected region (`AWS S3 region`) of the AWS bucket is incorrect. Check to confirm that you have specified the region in which the bucket was created.

| *The specified bucket does not exist*
| Create the bucket specified in the `AWS S3 bucket name` property, or provide the correct name of the existing bucket.

| *No files in the S3 bucket*
| Be sure to wait until the connector completes the first file flush (default 60 seconds). Verify that the topics specified are correct. Then verify that the topics contain messages to be pushed to S3.
