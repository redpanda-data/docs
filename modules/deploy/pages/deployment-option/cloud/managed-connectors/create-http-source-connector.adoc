= Create an HTTP Source Connector
:description: Use the Redpanda Cloud UI to create a HTTP Source Connector.
:page-cloud: true

You can use an HTTP Source connector to enable change data capture (CDC) from
JSON/HTTP APIs into Redpanda. The HTTP Source connector imports data from HTTP
services as batches or increments.

== Prerequisites

* A request URL that is accessible by the connector
* A user/password created in source so that the connector can authenticate

== Limitations

Only `JSON` or `AVRO` formats can be used as a value converter.

== Create an HTTP Source connector

To create the HTTP Source connector:

. In Redpanda Cloud, click *Connectors* in the navigation menu, and then
click *Create Connector*.
. Select *Import from HTTP*.
. On the *Create Connector* page, specify the following required connector
configuration options:
+
|===
| Property name | Property key | Description

| `Topic`
| `kafka.topic`
| Name of the topic where the record will be sent.

| `HTTP URL`
| `http.request.url`
| HTTP URL to use in the request.

| `HTTP request params`
| `http.request.params`
| HTTP query parameters to use in the request. Use `&` separated list = separated pairs. For example, `name=value&name2=value2`.

| `Authentication type`
| `http.auth.type`
| Type of authentication. If using `Basic`, provide `User` and `Password`. Default is None.

| `User`
| `http.auth.user`
| Basic authentication user.

| `Password`
| `http.auth.password`
| Basic authentication password.

| `Kafka message key format`
| `key.converter`
| Format of the key in the Redpanda topic. Default is `JSON`. If choosing `AVRO`, specify the `Kafka message key format`.

| `Message key JSON contains schema`
| `key.converter.schemas.enable`
| Specifies whether or not the message key contains schema in the schema field.

| `Kafka message value format`
| `value.converter`
| Format of the value in the Redpanda topic. Default is `JSON`. If choosing `AVRO`, specify the `Kafka message value format`.

| `Message value JSON contains schema`
| `value.converter.schemas.enable`
| Specifies whether or not the message value contains schema in the schema field.

| `Max Tasks`
| `tasks.max`
| Maximum number of tasks to use for this connector. The default is `1`. Each task replicates an exclusive set of partitions assigned to it.

| `Connector name`
| `name`
| Globally-unique name to use for this connector.
|===

. Click *Next*. Review the connector properties specified, then click *Create*.

== Map data

Use `JSON` (`org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter`) or `AVRO` (`io.confluent.connect.avro.AvroConverter`)
converters to map data from an HTTP endpoint to a Redpanda topic.

== Test the connection

After the connector is created:

* Check the connector status and confirm that there are no errors in logs and in Redpanda Console.
* Review the Redpanda topic to confirm that it contains the expected data.

== Troubleshoot

Most HTTP Source connector issues are reported as a failed task. An invalid connection
URL is reported in logs.
Select *Show Logs* to view error details.

Additional errors and corrective actions follow.

|===
| Message | Action

| *RetriableException: java.net.UnknownHostException: invalid-url.com.pl: Name or service not known / RetriableException: java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Connect timed out*
| Verify that the HTTP URL is correct, the hostname and port are correct, and that the service accepts connections.

| *IllegalStateException: Policy failed for response code: 403*
| Confirm that the service URL accepts requests from the connector, with HTTP code 200.

| *IllegalArgumentException: No node at '/items' (unmatched part: '/items')*
| Confirm that `HTTP response list pointer` is a valid pointer in the HTTP result document.

| *IllegalArgumentException: No node at '/invalid-key' (unmatched part: '/invalid-key')*
| Confirm that the `HTTP response record offset pointer` defines valid elements of the HTTP result document.
