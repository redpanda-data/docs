Choosing Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) ranges is an essential part of the VPC peering process, required to ensure that data transfers successfully between Redpanda and your cloud provider.

NOTE: These are general recommendations for choosing a CIDR range to peer. If you have a complex networking setup, work with a networking engineer to identify the Redpanda CIDRs that do not conflict with your existing VPCs.

== Prerequisites

* *VPC network*: Before setting up a peering connection in Redpanda Cloud, you must have another VPC to which Redpanda can connect. If you do not already have a network, create one in your cloud provider.
* *Matching region*: VPC peering connections can only be established between networks created in the _same region_. Redpanda Cloud does not support inter-region VPC peering connections.

TIP: Consider adding an `rp-` prefix to the VPC name to indicate that the VPC is for deploying a Redpanda cluster.

== What are CIDRs?

The following CIDR ranges are a critical part of Redpanda's BYOC configuration:

* Your existing (client) VPC CIDR
* Your Redpanda cluster CIDR

It is important to ensure that these ranges do not overlap when setting up VPC peering.

== Choose the CIDR ranges

To choose a range for Redpanda, you must know your VPC CIDR:

* In AWS, find it in the VPC area of the AWS Management Console, labeled *IPv4 CIDRs*.
* In GCP, find it in the Details view of your VPC, and labeled *Internal IP Ranges*.

You can check which IPs this range encompasses by using either the https://www.linux.com/topic/networking/how-calculate-network-addresses-ipcalc/[ipcalc^] command in your terminal or the https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr[CIDR calculation tool^]. For example, if your client's CIDR range is 10.0.0.0/20, run:

`ipcalc 10.0.0.0/20`

The output should look similar to the following:

[,bash]
----
Address:   10.0.0.0             00001010.00000000.0000 0000.00000000
Netmask:   255.255.240.0 = 20   11111111.11111111.1111 0000.00000000
Wildcard:  0.0.15.255           00000000.00000000.0000 1111.11111111
=>
Network:   10.0.0.0/20          00001010.00000000.0000 0000.00000000
HostMin:   10.0.0.1             00001010.00000000.0000 0000.00000001
HostMax:   10.0.15.254          00001010.00000000.0000 1111.11111110
Broadcast: 10.0.15.255          00001010.00000000.0000 1111.11111111
Hosts/Net: 4094                  Class A, Private Internet
----

Note the values for `HostMin` (10.0.0.1) and `HostMax` (10.0.15.254). These are the minimum and maximum values of the range of 4,094 IPs that this CIDR covers. The number of IPs is governed by the suffix: /16 contains 65534 IPs, /21 contains 2046, /24 contains 254, and so on. For private networks, this number can range from 8 (which contains 16777214 IPs) to 30 (which contains 2).

NOTE: The Redpanda CIDR requires a block size between /16 and /20.

== Example

Assume that your client's CIDR range is `10.0.0.0/20`. Your Redpanda range cannot overlap with it; if it does, VPC peering will not work.

A limited set of examples that work with `10.0.0.0/20` are `10.8.0.0/20`, `10.0.16.0/20`, or `10.1.0.0/20`.

Ranges like `10.0.0.6/20`, `10.0.8.0/20`, or `10.0.1.7/20` would not work. You can use http://trk.free.fr/ipcalc/tools.html[ipcalc^] to check for overlapping IPs.

== Multi-VPC example

If you have many IP ranges allocated in a complex system, seek guidance from a network engineer who can help with IP allocation. Your Redpanda CIDR cannot overlap with any of your existing VPCs, nor can it overlap with the VPC you want to peer with.

Assume that the following example ranges are in use:

* `10.0.0.0/20`
* `10.8.0.0/20`
* `10.0.35.8/20`
* `10.0.16.8/20`

A Redpanda CIDR that would work (and not overlap) with any of them is `10.8.48.8/20`
