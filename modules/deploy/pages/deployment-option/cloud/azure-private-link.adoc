:description: Set up Azure Private Link to securely access Redpanda Cloud.

include::shared:partial$feature-flag.adoc[]

The Redpanda Azure Private Link service provides secure access to Redpanda Cloud from your own VPC. Traffic over Azure Private Link does not go through the public internet because a Private Link connection is treated as its own private Azure service. While your VPC has access to the Redpanda VPC, Redpanda cannot access your VPC.

Consider using Private Link if you have multiple VPCs and could benefit from a more simplified approach to network management:

* Private Link allows overlapping xref:./cidr-ranges.adoc[CIDR ranges] in VPC networks.
* Private Link does not limit the number of connections.
After <<get-a-cloud-api-access-token,getting an access token>>, you can <<create-new-byoc-cluster-with-private-link-enabled,enable Private Link when creating a new BYOC cluster>>, or you can <<enable-private-link-on-an-existing-byoc-cluster,enable Private Link for existing BYOC clusters>>.

== Requirements

* In this guide, you use the xref:deploy:deployment-option/cloud/api/cloud-api-overview.adoc[Redpanda Cloud API] to enable the Redpanda endpoint service for your clusters. Follow the steps on this page to <<get-a-cloud-api-access-token, get an access token>>.
* Use the Azure CLI to create the consumer-side resources, such as a VPC and forwarding rule, or modify existing resources to use the Private Service Connect service attachment created for your cluster.
