:description: Learn about the metrics Redpanda uses to measure consumption in Redpanda Cloud.

Redpanda Cloud billing is mapped to the consumption of resources. When you create a cluster, you select a xref:deploy:deployment-option/cloud/cloud-overview.adoc#cluster-tiers[cluster tier] that specifies the expected throughput for your cluster, including the maximum ingress, egress, partitions, and connections. Billing is based on the resources consumed, multiplied by the cost of that resource.

* All pricing is set in US dollars (USD). The marketplace automatically converts the bill to the currency of the billing account. 
* All billing computations are conducted in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Billing accrues at hourly intervals. Any usage that is less than an hour is billed for the full hour. 

== Instance metric

The instance metric tracks the number of hours the instance is running. The cost varies based on the region and tier you select for your cluster.  

== Ingress and egress metrics

These metrics track the data transferred (in GB), including each produce and consume request.

* The ingress metric tracks data written. The cost varies based on the region you select for your cluster. 
* The egress metric tracks data read. The cost varies based on the number of availability zones (AZ) you select for your cluster. 

== Storage metric

The storage metric tracks the data (in GB) in object storage per hour.
