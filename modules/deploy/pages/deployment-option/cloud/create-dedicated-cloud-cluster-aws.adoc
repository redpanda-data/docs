After you log in to https://cloud.redpanda.com[Redpanda Cloud^], you land on the *Clusters* page. This lists all the clusters in your organization. 

== Create a Dedicated cluster

. On the Clusters page, click *Create cluster*, then click *Create Dedicated cluster*.
+
Enter a cluster name, then select the namespace, provider (AWS or GCP), region, availability zone type (single AZ or multi AZ) and zones, throughput tier, and Redpanda version.
+
[NOTE]
====
* If you plan to create a private network in your own VPC, select the region where your VPC is located.
* Three availability zones provide two backups in case one availability zone goes down.
* The xref:deploy:deployment-option/cloud/cloud-overview.adoc#cluster-tiers[tier] specifies the expected throughput for your cluster, including the maximum ingress, egress, partitions, and connections. 
* If your organization has more than one namespace, you must select the namespace for this cluster. 
====

. Click *Next*.
. On the Network page, enter the connection type: *Public* or *Private*.
+
Private networks require a VPC peering connection. See xref:./vpc-peering.adoc[Add a Dedicated VPC Peering Connection] to connect your VPC to the Redpanda Cloud VPC.

. Click *Create*.
+
After the cluster is created, you can click the cluster name on the *Home* page to see the overview for it.
