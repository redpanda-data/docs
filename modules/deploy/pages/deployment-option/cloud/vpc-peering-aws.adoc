= Add a BYOC VPC Peering Connection on AWS
:description: Use the Redpanda UI and AWS CLI to create a VPC peering connection for a BYOC cluster.
:page-cloud: true
:page-categories: Management, Networking

To start sending data to the Redpanda cluster, you must configure the VPC network connection by connecting your Redpanda VPC to your existing AWS VPC.

== Prerequisites

* An AWS account
* A running BYOC cluster in AWS. See xref:./create-byoc-cluster-aws.adoc[Create a BYOC Cluster on AWS].
* Your Redpanda cluster and VPC must be in the same region.

== Create a peering connection

. In the AWS management console or the CLI, create a new peering connection between your AWS VPC and your Redpanda network using the following:
** VPC Requester: Your Redpanda VPC. This looks something like `network-ch2c2ntioepec6ilaoog`.
** VPC Accepter: Your existing AWS VPC ID.
. After the VPC peering connection is created, make note of your peering connection ID. It has a `pcx-` prefix.

== Create routes from Redpanda to AWS

The following command routes traffic from Redpanda to AWS by finding the route tables for each associated subnet and creating a route:

[,bash]
----
aws ec2 describe-route-tables --filter "Name=tag:Name,Values=network-<redpanda-network-id>" "Name=tag:purpose,Values=private" | jq -r '.RouteTables[].RouteTableId' | \
while read -r route_table_id; do \
aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id $route_table_id --destination-cidr-block <aws-vpc-cidr-block> --vpc-peering-connection-id <peering-connection-id>; \
done;
----

Replace the following placeholder values:

* Redpanda network ID: This ID appears after clicking on the name of the *Redpanda network* in the *Details* section of the *Overview* page of your cluster. This network ID may look similar, however, it is distinct from your cluster ID.
* AWS CIDR block: This is listed in the AWS UI *Details* for your VPC.
* Peering connection ID: This is the ID of the peering connection noted in step one.

== Create routes from AWS to Redpanda

Now you must route your AWS
subnet(s) to your Redpanda CIDR. The base command:

[,bash]
----
aws ec2 --region <region> create-route \
  --route-table-id <aws-route-table-id> \
  --destination-cidr-block <redpanda-cidr-range> \
  --vpc-peering-connection-id <peering-connection-id>
----

Your VPC may have multiple subnets, which may have multiple route table associations. Add the route to all the subnets.

== Test your connection

There are two ways to test your connection:

* Return to your cluster overview, and follow the directions in the *How to connect* panel.
* Use the AWS https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/reachability/what-is-reachability-analyzer.html[Reachability Analyzer^]. Select your VM instance and a Redpanda instance as the source and destination, and test the connection between them.
