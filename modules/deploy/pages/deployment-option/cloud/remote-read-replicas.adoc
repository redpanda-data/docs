:description: Learn how to create a remote read replica topic, which is a read-only topic that mirrors a topic on a different cluster.

A remote read replica topic is a read-only topic that mirrors a topic on a different cluster. You can create a separate remote cluster just for consumers of this topic and populate its topics from object storage. A read-only topic on a remote cluster can serve any consumer, without increasing the load on the source cluster. Because these read-only topics access data directly from object storage, there's no impact to the performance of the cluster.

Redpanda Cloud supports remote read replicas with ephemeral BYOC clusters (not with a customer-managed VPC). Ephemeral clusters are temporary clusters created to handle specific, transient workloads or tasks. After processing, the cluster is terminated to free up resources and reduce costs. 

== Prerequisites

* A BYOC source cluster in Ready state.
* A BYOC reader cluster in Ready state. This separate reader cluster must exist in the same Redpanda organization and the same cloud provider account and region as the source cluster.

== Configure remote read replicas

You can add or remove reader clusters to a source cluster in Redpanda Cloud with the xref:api:ROOT:cloud-api.adoc[Cloud API]. For information on accessing the Cloud API, see xref:deploy:deployment-option/cloud/api/cloud-api-authentication.adoc[]. 

. To update your source cluster to add one or more reader cluster IDs, make a xref:api:ROOT:cloud-api.adoc#patch-/v1beta2/clusters/-cluster.id-[`PATCH /v1beta2/clusters/\{cluster.id}`] request. The full list of clusters is expected on every call. If an ID is removed from the list, it will be removed as a reader cluster.
+
```bash
export SOURCE_CLUSTER_ID=.......
export READER_CLUSTER_ID=.......

curl -X PATCH $API_HOST/v1beta2/clusters/$SOURCE_CLUSTER_ID \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
-d @- << EOF 
{
  "read_replica_cluster_ids": ["$READER_CLUSTER_ID"] 
}
EOF
```

. To create a remote read replica topic, run:
+
```bash
rpk topic create my-topic -c redpanda.remote.readreplica=redpanda-cloud-storage-${SOURCE_CLUSTER_ID}
```

. Optional: To see the list of reader clusters on a given source cluster, make a xref:api:ROOT:cloud-api.adoc#get-/v1beta2/clusters/-id-[`GET /v1beta2/clusters/\{id}`] request:
+
```bash
export SOURCE_CLUSTER_ID=.......

curl -X GET $API_HOST/v1beta2/clusters/$SOURCE_CLUSTER_ID \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN"
```

. Optional: For remote read replicas reading from a live topic (that is, a topic that's being actively written to by a source cluster), it may be advantageous to control how often segments are flushed to object storage. By default, this is set to 60 minutes. To tune `cloud_storage_segment_max_upload_interval_sec` on the source cluster, contact https://support.redpanda.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[Redpanda support^]. (For cold topics, where segments are closed and older than 60 minutes, this configuration is unnecessary: the data is already uploaded to object storage.)

[NOTE]
====
A source cluster cannot be deleted if it has remote read replica topics. When you delete a reader cluster, that cluster's ID is removed from any existing source cluster `read_replica_cluster_ids` lists.
