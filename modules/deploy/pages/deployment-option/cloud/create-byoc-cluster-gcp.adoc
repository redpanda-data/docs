= Create a BYOC Cluster on GCP
:description: Use the Redpanda Cloud UI to create a BYOC cluster on GCP.
:page-aliases: cloud:create-byoc-cluster-gcp.adoc

To create a Redpanda cluster in your virtual private cloud (VPC), log in to https://cloud.redpanda.com[Redpanda Cloud^].

NOTE: With standard BYOC clusters, Redpanda manages security policies and resources for your VPC, including subnetworks, service accounts, IAM roles, firewall rules, and storage buckets. For the most security, you can manage these resources yourself with a xref:./vpc-byo-gcp.adoc[customer-managed VPC on GCP].

== Create a BYOC cluster

. On the Clusters page, click *Create cluster*, then click *Create BYOC cluster*.
+
Enter a cluster name, then select the resource group, provider (GCP), xref:deploy:deployment-option/cloud/byoc-tiers.adoc[region, availability zones, tier], and Redpanda version.
+
[NOTE]
====
* If you plan to create a private network in your own VPC, select the region where your VPC is located.
* Three availability zones provide two backups in case one availability zone goes down.
====
+ 
Optionally, click *Advanced settings* to specify up to five key-value custom labels. After the cluster is created, the labels are applied to all GCP resources associated with this cluster. For more information, see the https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/labeling-resources[GCP documentation^].

. Click *Next*.
. On the Network page, enter the connection type: either *Public* or *Private*. For BYOC clusters, *Private* is best-practice.
** Your network name is used to identify this network.
** For a xref:./cidr-ranges.adoc[CIDR range], choose one that does not overlap with your existing VPCs or your Redpanda network.
. Click *Next*.
. On the Deploy page, follow the steps to log in to Redpanda Cloud and deploy the agent.
+
Note that `rpk` configures the permissions required by the agent to provision and actively maintain the cluster. For details about these permissions, see xref:./security/authorization/cloud-iam-policies-gcp.adoc[GCP IAM permissions].
