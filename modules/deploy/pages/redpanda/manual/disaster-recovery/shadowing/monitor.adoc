Monitor your shadow links to ensure proper replication performance and understand your disaster recovery readiness. Use `rpk` commands, metrics, and status information to track shadow link health and troubleshoot issues.

== Status commands

List existing shadow links:

[,bash]
----
rpk shadow list
----

View shadow link configuration details:

[,bash]
----
rpk shadow describe <my-disaster-recovery-link>
----

This command shows the complete configuration of the shadow link, including connection settings, filters, and synchronization options.

Check your shadow link status to ensure proper operation:

[,bash]
----
rpk shadow status <shadow-link-name>
----

**Status command options:**

[,bash]
----
rpk shadow status <shadow-link-name>
----

For troubleshooting specific issues, you can use command options to show individual status sections. See the rpk reference for available status options.

The status output includes:

* **Shadow link state**: Overall operational state (`ACTIVE`)
* **Individual topic states**: Current state of each replicated topic (`ACTIVE`, `FAULTED`, `FAILING_OVER`, `FAILED_OVER`)
* **Task status**: Health of replication tasks across brokers (`ACTIVE`, `FAULTED`, `NOT_RUNNING`, `LINK_UNAVAILABLE`)
* **Lag information**: Replication lag per partition showing source vs shadow watermarks

== Metrics

Shadowing provides comprehensive metrics to track replication performance and health:

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Metric |Type |Description

|`redpanda_shadow_link_shadow_lag`
|Gauge
|The lag of the shadow partition against the source partition, calculated as source partition LSO minus shadow partition HWM. Monitor by `shadow_link_name`, `topic`, and `partition` to understand replication lag for each partition.

|`redpanda_shadow_link_total_bytes_fetched`
|Count
|The total number of bytes fetched by a sharded replicator (bytes received by the client). Labeled by `shadow_link_name` and `shard` to track data transfer volume from the source cluster.

|`redpanda_shadow_link_total_bytes_written`
|Count
|The total number of bytes written by a sharded replicator (bytes written to the write_at_offset_stm). Uses `shadow_link_name` and `shard` labels to monitor data written to the shadow cluster.

|`redpanda_shadow_link_client_errors`
|Count
|The number of errors seen by the client. Track by `shadow_link_name` and `shard` to identify connection or protocol issues between clusters.

|`redpanda_shadow_link_shadow_topic_state`
|Gauge
|Number of shadow topics in the respective states. Labeled by `shadow_link_name` and `state` to monitor topic state distribution across your shadow links.

|`redpanda_shadow_link_total_records_fetched`
|Count
|The total number of records fetched by the sharded replicator (records received by the client). Monitor by `shadow_link_name` and `shard` to track message throughput from the source.

|`redpanda_shadow_link_total_records_written`
|Count
|The total number of records written by a sharded replicator (records written to the write_at_offset_stm). Uses `shadow_link_name` and `shard` labels to monitor message throughput to the shadow cluster.

== Monitoring best practices

=== Health check procedures

Establish regular monitoring workflows to ensure shadow link health:

**Health checks:**
[,bash]
----
# Check all shadow links are active
rpk shadow list | grep -v "ACTIVE" || echo "All shadow links healthy"

# Monitor lag for critical topics  
rpk shadow status <shadow-link-name> | grep -E "LAG|Lag"
----

=== Alert thresholds

Configure monitoring alerts for:

* **High replication lag**: When `redpanda_shadow_link_shadow_lag` exceeds your RPO requirements
* **Connection errors**: When `redpanda_shadow_link_client_errors` increases rapidly
* **Topic state changes**: When topics move to `FAULTED` state
* **Task failures**: When replication tasks enter `FAULTED` or `NOT_RUNNING` states
* **Link unavailability**: When tasks show `LINK_UNAVAILABLE` indicating source cluster connectivity issues
* **Throughput drops**: When bytes/records fetched drops significantly
