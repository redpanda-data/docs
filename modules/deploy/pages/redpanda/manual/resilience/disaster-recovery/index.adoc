== Choose Your Approach

**For real-time disaster recovery:**
Use xref:shadowing/index.adoc[Shadowing] when you need minimal data loss and rapid recovery. Shadowing continuously replicates data across regions, enabling near-instant failover with preserved offsets and consumer positions.

**For backup-based recovery:**
Use xref:./whole-cluster-restore.adoc[Whole Cluster Restore] when you need complete cluster reconstruction from a specific point in time. This approach works with xref:manage:tiered-storage.adoc[Tiered Storage] to restore entire clusters from object storage.

**For selective recovery:**
Use xref:./topic-recovery.adoc[Topic Recovery] when you need to restore specific topics or partitions without affecting the entire cluster. This is ideal for targeted data recovery scenarios.
