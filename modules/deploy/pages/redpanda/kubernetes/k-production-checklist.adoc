This checklist validates Redpanda deployments in Kubernetes against production readiness standards. Use the automated checker script to verify most requirements, and complete manual checks for comprehensive production preparation.

TIP: The automated production readiness checker (`check-redpanda-readiness-modular.py`) can validate most of these requirements automatically. Run it against your Kubernetes deployment to get a comprehensive assessment.

== Critical Production Requirements

These checks are essential for a stable, reliable production deployment. All critical requirements should pass before going live.

=== Deployment Method Validation

==== Automated Checks

**Deployment method detection**:: Verify that the deployment method (Helm or Operator) is properly detected and configured.
+
[,bash]
----
./check-redpanda-readiness-modular.py -n <namespace> -d <deployment-name>
----

**Operator CRDs validation** (Operator deployments only):: Ensure all required Custom Resource Definitions are installed and available.
+
Required CRDs:
+
* `clusters.cluster.redpanda.com`
* `topics.cluster.redpanda.com`
* `users.cluster.redpanda.com`
* `schemas.cluster.redpanda.com`

=== Cluster Health and Configuration

==== Automated Checks

**Cluster health status**:: Verify the cluster reports as healthy with no broker issues.
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl exec -n <namespace> <pod-name> -c redpanda -- rpk cluster health
----

**Minimum broker count (≥3)**:: Ensure at least 3 brokers are running for production fault tolerance.
+
Production clusters should have odd numbers of brokers (3, 5, 7, etc.) for optimal consensus behavior.

**Default topic replication factor (≥3)**:: Verify the default replication factor is set appropriately for production.
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl exec -n <namespace> <pod-name> -c redpanda -- rpk cluster config get default_topic_replications
----

**Existing topics replication factor (≥3)**:: Check that all existing topics have adequate replication.
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl exec -n <namespace> <pod-name> -c redpanda -- rpk topic list
----

**No brokers in maintenance mode**:: Ensure no brokers are currently in maintenance mode during normal operations.

**All brokers active membership**:: Verify all brokers are in active state and not being decommissioned.

=== Storage Configuration

==== Automated Checks

**Persistent storage configuration**:: Verify using persistent storage (not hostPath) for data persistence.
+
HostPath storage is not suitable for production as it lacks durability guarantees.

==== Manual Checks

**Storage class performance**:: Ensure storage classes provide adequate IOPS and throughput for your workload.
+
* For high-throughput workloads: Use SSD-based storage classes
* Consider provisioned IOPS where available
* Test storage performance under load

**Volume sizing**:: Plan storage capacity for data growth and retention requirements.
+
* Account for replication overhead
* Include space for compaction operations
* Monitor disk usage trends

=== Resource Allocation

==== Automated Checks

**CPU and memory resource limits**:: Verify pods have resource requests and limits configured.
+
All Redpanda pods must have:
+
* CPU requests and limits
* Memory requests and limits

**CPU to memory ratio (1:2 minimum)**:: Ensure adequate memory allocation relative to CPU for optimal performance.
+
Production deployments should provision at least 2 GiB of memory per CPU core.

==== Manual Checks

**Resource capacity planning**:: Ensure nodes have adequate resources for the configured limits.
+
* Verify cluster has sufficient total resources
* Account for other workloads on shared nodes
* Plan for resource growth and burst capacity

=== Security Configuration

==== Automated Checks

**Authorization enabled**:: Verify Kafka authorization is enabled for access control.
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl exec -n <namespace> <pod-name> -c redpanda -- rpk cluster config get kafka_enable_authorization
----

**Developer mode disabled**:: Ensure developer mode is disabled in production configuration.
+
Developer mode should never be enabled in production environments.

==== Manual Checks

**Authentication configuration**:: Configure appropriate authentication mechanisms.
+
* Set up SASL authentication for client connections
* Configure TLS certificates for encryption
* Implement proper user management and ACLs

**Network security**:: Secure network access to the cluster.
+
* Configure NetworkPolicies to restrict pod-to-pod communication
* Use TLS for all client connections
* Secure admin API endpoints

== Recommended Production Enhancements

These checks improve operational robustness and performance but are not critical for basic functionality.

=== Cluster Configuration

==== Automated Checks

**Redpanda license verification**:: Validate Enterprise license if using Enterprise features.

**Consistent Redpanda version**:: Ensure all brokers run the same Redpanda version.
+
Version mismatches can cause compatibility issues and should be resolved.

=== Storage Optimization

==== Automated Checks

**XFS filesystem for data directory**:: Verify data directories use XFS filesystem for optimal performance.
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl exec -n <namespace> <pod-name> -c redpanda -- df -khT <data-directory>
----

==== Manual Checks

**Storage performance tuning**:: Optimize storage configuration for production workloads.
+
* Configure appropriate `vm.swappiness` settings
* Tune filesystem mount options
* Consider storage class performance characteristics

=== Resource Optimization

==== Automated Checks

**Pod anti-affinity rules**:: Configure pod anti-affinity to spread brokers across nodes.
+
This prevents single node failures from affecting multiple brokers.

**Pod Disruption Budget configured**:: Set up PDBs to control voluntary disruptions during maintenance.

**No fractional CPU requests**:: Ensure CPU requests use whole numbers for consistent performance.
+
Fractional CPUs can lead to performance variability in production.

**Node isolation configuration**:: Configure taints/tolerations or nodeSelector for workload isolation.
+
Isolating Redpanda workloads improves performance predictability.

==== Manual Checks

**CPU pinning and NUMA awareness**:: Configure CPU affinity for optimal performance on multi-core systems.

**Memory allocation strategy**:: Optimize memory settings for your workload patterns.

=== Security Enhancements

==== Automated Checks

**Overprovisioned disabled**:: Ensure overprovisioned mode is disabled for production stability.

**System requirements validation**:: Run system checks to validate optimal configuration.
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl exec -n <namespace> <pod-name> -c redpanda -- rpk redpanda check
----

==== Manual Checks

**Security scanning**:: Regularly scan container images and configurations for vulnerabilities.

**Backup and recovery procedures**:: Implement and test backup and recovery processes.
+
* Configure topic backups
* Test cluster recovery procedures
* Document emergency response procedures

**Audit logging**:: Enable and configure audit logging for compliance requirements.

== Monitoring and Observability

=== Manual Checks

**Monitoring setup**:: Deploy comprehensive monitoring for cluster health and performance.
+
* Set up Prometheus metrics collection
* Configure Grafana dashboards
* Implement alerting rules

**Log aggregation**:: Configure centralized log collection and analysis.
+
* Forward Redpanda logs to central logging system
* Set up log retention policies
* Configure log-based alerting

**Health checks**:: Implement application-level health checks.
+
* Configure Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes
* Set up external health monitoring
* Define SLI/SLO metrics

== Operational Readiness

=== Manual Checks

**Deployment automation**:: Implement Infrastructure as Code for reproducible deployments.
+
* Use Helm charts or Kubernetes manifests in version control
* Implement GitOps workflows
* Automate testing and validation

**Upgrade procedures**:: Document and test cluster upgrade processes.
+
* Plan for rolling upgrades with zero downtime
* Test upgrade procedures in staging environments
* Implement rollback capabilities

**Incident response**:: Prepare for operational incidents and outages.
+
* Document troubleshooting procedures
* Establish on-call processes
* Create incident response playbooks

== Running the Automated Checker

Use the automated checker to validate most requirements:

[,bash]
----
# Basic check (shows only issues)
./check-redpanda-readiness-modular.py -n <namespace> -d <deployment-name>

# Verbose output (shows all results)
./check-redpanda-readiness-modular.py -n <namespace> -d <deployment-name> -v

# Generate JSON report
./check-redpanda-readiness-modular.py -n <namespace> -d <deployment-name> -o report.json
----

The script automatically detects deployment methods and validates configurations against production standards.

== Next Steps

After completing this checklist:

1. **Performance testing**: Conduct load testing to validate performance under expected traffic.
2. **Disaster recovery testing**: Test backup and recovery procedures.
3. **Security review**: Conduct security assessment and penetration testing.
4. **Operational validation**: Verify monitoring, alerting, and incident response procedures.
