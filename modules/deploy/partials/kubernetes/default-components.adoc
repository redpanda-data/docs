= Explore the default Kubernetes components

By default, the Redpanda Helm chart deploys the following Kubernetes components:

* <<StatefulSet,A StatefulSet>> with three Pods.
* <<PersistentVolumeClaim,One PersistentVolumeClaim>> for each Pod, each with a capacity of 20Gi.
* <<Service,A headless ClusterIP Service and a NodePort Service>> for each Kubernetes node that runs a Redpanda broker.
* <<TLS Certificates,Self-Signed TLS Certificates>>.

== StatefulSet

Redpanda is a stateful application. Each Redpanda broker needs to store its own state (topic partitions) in its own storage volume.
As a result, the Helm chart deploys a StatefulSet to manage the Pods in which the Redpanda brokers are running.

[,bash]
----
kubectl get statefulset --namespace <namespace>
----

Example output:

[.no-copy]
----
NAME       READY   AGE
redpanda   3/3     3m11s
----

StatefulSets ensure that the state associated with a particular Pod replica is always the same, no matter how often the Pod is recreated.
Each Pod is also given a unique ordinal number in its name such as `redpanda-0`.
A Pod with a particular ordinal number is always associated with a PersistentVolumeClaim with the same number.
When a Pod in the StatefulSet is deleted and recreated,
it is given the same ordinal number and so it mounts the same storage volume as the deleted Pod that it replaced.

[,bash]
----
kubectl get pod --namespace <namespace>
----

```

NOTE: The `redpanda-configuration` job updates the Redpanda runtime configuration.
====

== PersistentVolumeClaim

Redpanda brokers must be able to store their data on disk.
By default, the Helm chart uses the default StorageClass in the Kubernetes cluster to create a PersistentVolumeClaim for each Pod.
The default StorageClass in your Kubernetes cluster depends on the Kubernetes platform that you are using.

[,bash]
----
kubectl get persistentvolumeclaims --namespace <namespace>
----

```
====

== Service

The clients writing to or reading from a given partition have to connect directly to the leader broker that hosts the partition.
As a result, clients need to be able to connect directly to each Pod.
To allow internal and external clients to connect to each Pod that hosts a Redpanda broker, the Helm chart configures two Services:

* Internal using the <<headless-clusterip-service,Headless ClusterIP>>
* External using the <<nodeport-service,NodePort>>

[,bash]
----
kubectl get service --namespace <namespace>

=== Headless ClusterIP Service

The headless Service associated with a StatefulSet gives the Pods their network identity in the form of a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). Both Redpanda brokers in the same Redpanda cluster and clients within the same Kubernetes cluster use this FQDN to communicate with each other.

An important requirement of distributed applications such as Redpanda is peer discovery: The ability for each broker to find other brokers in the same cluster.
When each Pod is rolled out, its `seed_servers` field is updated with the FQDN of each Pod in the cluster so that they can discover each other.

[,bash]
----
kubectl --namespace <namespace> exec redpanda-0 -c redpanda -- cat etc/redpanda/redpanda.yaml
----

[,yaml]
----
redpanda:
  data_directory: /var/lib/redpanda/data
  empty_seed_starts_cluster: false
  seed_servers:
  - host:
      address: redpanda-0.redpanda.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local.
      port: 33145
  - host:
      address: redpanda-1.redpanda.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local.
      port: 33145
  - host:
      address: redpanda-2.redpanda.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local.
      port: 33145
----

=== NodePort Service

External access is made available by a NodePort service that opens the following ports by default:

|===
| Listener| Node Port | Container Port

| Schema Registry
| 30081
| 8081

| HTTP Proxy
| 30082
| 8083

| Kafka API
| 31092
| 9094

| Admin API
| 31644
| 9644
|===

== TLS Certificates

By default, TLS is enabled in the Redpanda Helm chart.
The Helm chart uses glossterm:cert-manager[] to generate four Certificate resources
that provide Redpanda with self-signed certificates for internal and external connections.

Having separate certificates for internal and external connections provides security isolation.
If an external certificate or its corresponding private key is compromised,
it doesn't affect the security of internal communications.

[,bash]
----
kubectl get certificate --namespace <namespace>
----

[.no-copy]
----
NAME                                 READY
redpanda-default-cert                True
redpanda-default-root-certificate    True
redpanda-external-cert               True
redpanda-external-root-certificate   True
----

- `redpanda-default-cert`: Self-signed certificate for internal communications.
- `redpanda-default-root-certificate`: Root certificate authority for the internal certificate.
- `redpanda-external-cert`: Self-signed certificate for external communications.
- `redpanda-external-root-certificate`: Root certificate authority for the external certificate.

By default, all listeners are configured with the same certificate. To configure separate TLS certificates for different listeners, see xref:manage:kubernetes/security/kubernetes-tls.adoc[].

NOTE: The Redpanda Helm chart provides self-signed certificates for convenience. In a production environment, it's best to use certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or integrate with your existing CA infrastructure.
