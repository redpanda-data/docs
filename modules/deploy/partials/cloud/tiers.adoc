== BYOC supported tiers

When you create a BYOC cluster, you select your usage tier. Each tier provides guaranteed workload configurations for throughput, partitions, and connections. 

|=== 
| Tier | Maximum ingress | Maximum egress | Maximum logical partitions | Maximum connections

| Tier 1 | 20 MBps | 60 MBps | 1,000 | 9,000
| Tier 2 | 50 MBps | 150 MBps | 2,800 | 22,500
| Tier 3 | 100 MBps | 200 MBps | 5,600 | 45,000
| Tier 4 | 200 MBps | 400 MBps | 11,300 | 90,000
| Tier 5 | 400 MBps | 800 MBps | 22,800 | 180,000
| Tier 6 | 800 MBps | 1,600 MBps | 45,000 | 180,000
| Tier 7 | 1,200 MBps | 2,400 MBps | 67,500 | 270,000
| Tier 8 | 1,600 MBps | 3,200 MBps | 90,000 | 360,000
| Tier 9 | 2,000 MBps | 4,000 MBps | 112,500 | 450,000

Connections are regulated per broker for best performance. For example, in a tier 1 cluster with 3 brokers, there could be approximately 3,000 connections per broker.
