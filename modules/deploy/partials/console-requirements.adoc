== Hardware requirements

The following hardware requirements are recommended for running Redpanda Console:

=== CPU

* **Minimum**: 2 CPU cores
* **Recommended**: 4+ CPU cores for production workloads

Redpanda Console is CPU-intensive during operations such as:

* Message deserialization and filtering
* Schema registry operations
* Real-time data streaming to the web interface

=== Memory

* **Minimum**: 1 GB RAM
* **Recommended**: 4+ GB RAM for production workloads

Memory usage scales with:

* Number of concurrent users
* Message throughput and batch sizes
* xref:console:ui/programmable-push-filters.adoc[Programmable push filter] complexity
* Schema registry cache size

=== Storage

* **Minimum**: 1 GB available disk space
* **Recommended**: 10+ GB for logs, caches, and temporary files

== Scaling considerations

The following factors can impact the scalability of Redpanda Console:

=== Multiple replicas

Deploy multiple Redpanda Console replicas for:

* **High availability**: Eliminate single points of failure
* **Load distribution**: Handle increased user traffic
* **Rolling updates**: Zero-downtime deployments

=== Auto-scaling

Consider using link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/[Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)] to automatically scale based on CPU and memory utilization.

== Schema Registry integration

When integrating with Schema Registry:

* **Additional memory**: Allocate extra memory for schema caching
* **Network connectivity**: Ensure reliable connectivity to Schema Registry endpoints
* **Authentication**: Configure appropriate credentials for Schema Registry access

== Separate node deployment

Consider deploying Redpanda Console on separate nodes from Redpanda brokers for:

* **Resource isolation**: Prevent resource contention between Console and Redpanda brokers
* **Operational independence**: Maintain Console availability during Redpanda maintenance
* **Security boundaries**: Separate workloads for enhanced security posture
* **Maintenance flexibility**: Perform node maintenance without affecting both services

== Software requirements

=== Operating system

Redpanda Console supports:

* **Linux**: All major distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, Debian)
* **Container platforms**: Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift
* **Cloud platforms**: AWS, GCP, Azure

=== Network requirements

* **Redpanda connectivity**: TCP access to Redpanda brokers on configured ports
* **Web interface**: HTTP/HTTPS access for users (typically port 8080 or 443)
* **Schema Registry**: TCP access to Schema Registry if used

== Security considerations

* **TLS encryption**: Configure TLS for all network communications
* **Authentication**: Set up appropriate authentication mechanisms
* **RBAC**: Implement role-based access control where supported
