= Start Redpanda

To start Redpanda:

[,bash]
----
sudo systemctl start redpanda-tuner redpanda
----

When a Redpanda cluster starts, it instantiates a controller Raft group with all the seed servers specified in the `--ips` flag. After all seed servers complete their startup procedure and become accessible, the cluster is then available. After that, non-seed servers start up and are added to the cluster.
