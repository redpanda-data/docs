= Verify the installation

To verify that the Redpanda cluster is up and running, use `rpk` to get information about the cluster:

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster info
----

You should see a list of advertised addresses.

To create a topic:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic create <topic-name>
----

If topics were initially created in a test environment with a replication factor of `1`, use `rpk topic alter-config` to change the topic replication factor:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic alter-config <topic-names> --set replication.factor=3
----
