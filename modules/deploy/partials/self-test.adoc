= Perform a self test

To understand the performance capabilities of your Redpanda cluster, Redpanda offers built-in self-test features that evaluate the performance of both disk and network operations.

For more information, see xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/cluster-diagnostics.adoc#self-test[Disk and network self-test benchmarks].

When using the storage bandwidth test, ensure that your results show at least 16,000 IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) for production environments. If your test results are below this threshold, your storage may not be suitable for production Redpanda workloads.
