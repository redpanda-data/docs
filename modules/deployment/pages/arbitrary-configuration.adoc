= Arbitrary configuration parameters for the Redpanda operator
:description: Additional configuration parameters for the Redpanda operator.

Before continuing please go over the xref:quickstart:kubernetes-qs-cloud.adoc[Kubernetes Quick Start Guide] and follow the steps for setting up the Redpanda Operator and optionally a Redpanda cluster.

Once the Redpanda Operator is installed a Redpanda cluster can be created by _applying_ a Cluster Custom Resource (CR) containing the specification of the desired Redpanda cluster. The CR includes the desired Redpanda Cluster name, namespace, and configuration for the Admin, Kafka, Pandaproxy API, and others.

The cluster definition includes properties that are commonly used to configure at both cluster and node levels.
However, Redpanda offers a broad range of custom properties for xref:cluster-administration:node-property-configuration.adoc[node configuration] besides cluster configuration.

For this reason, Redpanda introduced the `additionalConfiguration` property, which allows you to include arbitrary configuration properties not included in the CR.
For example, consider the `single-node sample` found in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/tree/dev/src/go/k8s/config/samples[our sample files] with `additionalConfiguration` added:

== Sample configuration

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: redpanda.vectorized.io/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: one-node-cluster
spec:
  image: "vectorized/redpanda"
  version: "latest"
  replicas: 1
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 1
      memory: 1.2Gi
    limits:
      cpu: 1
      memory: 1.2Gi
  configuration:
    rpcServer:
      port: 33145
    kafkaApi:
    - port: 9092
    pandaproxyApi:
    - port: 8082
    adminApi:
    - port: 9644
    developerMode: true
  additionalConfiguration:
    pandaproxy_client.retries: "10"
    schema_registry.schema_registry_api: "[{'name':'external','address':'0.0.0.0','port':8081}]"
----

You may also set additional configuration properties at the cluster level, if you set the `enable_idempotency` property to `true`:

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster config set enable_idempotence true
----

To define the `default_topic_partitions` property with a new value:

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster config set default_topic_partitions 3
----

The `additionalConfiguration` map includes parameters that are not part of the Custom Resource, but are passed to the Redpanda configuration (`redpanda.yaml`).

The format of each entry is `<subsystem>.<property_name>: <value>`. Examples of subsystems, as seen above, are `redpanda`, `pandaproxy_client`, and `schema_registry`. The value can be a single value or a YAML/JSON-encoded string, as is the case with the `schema_registry` parameter in the example.

Once the above specification is applied, the Redpanda logs should include

[,yaml]
----
 pandaproxy_client:
  ..
  retries: 10
redpanda:
  ..
  default_topic_partitions: 3
  enable_idempotence: true
  ..
...
schema_registry:
  schema_registry_api:
    - address: 0.0.0.0
      name: external
      port: 8081
----

To verify the values for the cluster configuration:

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster config get enable_idempotence
true
----

or

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster config get default_topic_partitions
3
----

== Limitations

When using this capability keep in mind some limitations:

* versioning is not supported for the `additionalConfiguration` parameters
* key names not supported by Redpanda will lead to failure on start
* updating this map requires a manual restart of the Redpanda pods
