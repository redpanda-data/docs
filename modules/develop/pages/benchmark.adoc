= Benchmark Redpanda
:description: Learn how to measure the performance of a Redpanda cluster deployed on AWS EC2 instances with the OpenMessaging Benchmark.

Learn how to measure the performance of a Redpanda cluster deployed on AWS EC2 instances with the Linux Foundation's OpenMessaging Benchmark. Run the same tests and workloads that Redpanda uses to demonstrate significantly better performance than Apache Kafka.

== About OpenMessaging Benchmark

The https://openmessaging.cloud/docs/benchmarks/[Linux Foundation's OpenMessaging Benchmark^] (OMB) Framework is an open-source, cloud-based benchmark framework that supports several messaging systems, including Kafka, and is configurable for workloads representing real-world use cases.

Redpanda Data provides a https://github.com/redpanda-data/openmessaging-benchmark[fork of OMB on Github^] with some updates:

* Fixed coalescing of asynchronous consumer offset requests in the OMB Kafka driver.
* Support for Kafka 3.2.0 clients.

=== OMB workloads

An OMB workload is a benchmark configuration that sets the producers, consumers, topics, and messages used by a test, as well as the production rate and duration of each test. An OMB workload is specified in a YAML configuration file.

.Example workload configuration file
[%collapsible]
====
The content of an OMB workload configuration file, copied from Redpanda Data's https://github.com/redpanda-data/openmessaging-benchmark/blob/main/workloads/1-topic-1-partition-1kb.yaml[fork of OMB^]:

```
name: 1 topic / 1 partition / 1Kb

topics: 1
partitionsPerTopic: 1
keyDistributor: "NO_KEY"
messageSize: 1024
payloadFile: "payload/payload-1Kb.data"
subscriptionsPerTopic: 1
consumerPerSubscription: 1
producersPerTopic: 1
producerRate: 50000
consumerBacklogSizeGB: 0
testDurationMinutes: 15
```

The `keyDistributor` property configures how keys are distributed and assigned to messages.
- `NO_KEY` sets `null` for all keys.
- `KEY_ROUND_ROBIN` cycles through a finite set of keys in round-robin fashion.
- `RANDOM_NANO` returns random keys based on `System.nanoTime()`.

== Set up benchmark

Running OMB with Redpanda requires setting up your local environment to provision and start a Redpanda cluster in AWS.

. Install CLI tools.
** https://maven.apache.org/install.html[Maven^]
** https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads[Terraform^] with https://github.com/adammck/terraform-inventory[terraform-inventory plugin^]
** https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html[Ansible^] (v2.11 or higher)
** Python 3 and pip
** A window manager like https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki[tmux^] or https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen[screen^] that supports detachable screen sessions.
+
TIP: Redpanda Data recommends running the benchmark executable with a window manager that supports detachable screen sessions, like tmux or screen, so the benchmark can continue to run in the background even after you disconnect.
. Clone the Redpanda Data fork of OMB.
+
[,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/redpanda-data/openmessaging-benchmark
----
+
The repository contains a directory for the Redpanda driver, `openmessaging-benchmark/driver-redpanda`. Subsequent steps read and configure files in that directory.

. Customize the `openmessaging-benchmark/driver-redpanda/pom.xml` file with your Kafka client version if necessary (currently 3.3.1):
+
.`pom.xml`
```xml
...
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.kafka</groupId>
    <artifactId>kafka-clients</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.1</version>
</dependency>
...
```

. From the repository root directory, build the benchmark client.
+
[,bash]
----
cd openmessaging-benchmark
mvn clean install -Dlicense.skip=true
----

. From the Redpanda driver directory, install the Ansible roles required for deploying Redpanda.
+
[,bash]
----
cd driver-redpanda/deploy
ansible-galaxy install -r driver-redpanda/deploy/requirements.yaml
----

. Configure AWS credentials and SSH keys.
.. https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[Install^] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html[configure^] AWS CLI.
.. Generate SSH keys:
+
[,bash]
----
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/redpanda_aws
----
+
When prompted for a passphrase, set a blank passphrase by pressing kbd:[Enter] twice.
.. Verify the SSH key files were created.
+
[,bash]
----
ls ~/.ssh/redpanda_aws*
----
. Provision a Redpanda cluster to deploy on AWS with Terraform.
.. Customize the `openmessaging-benchmark/deploy/terraform.tfvars` Terraform configuration file for your environment.
+
.Default Terraform configuration for Redpanda on AWS
[%collapsible]
====
The default contents of `openmessaging-benchmark/driver-redpanda/deploy/terraform.tfvars`:

```
public_key_path = "~/.ssh/redpanda_aws.pub"
region          = "us-west-2"
az              = "us-west-2a"
ami             = "ami-0d31d7c9fc9503726"
profile         = "default"
instance_types = {
"redpanda"      = "i3en.6xlarge"
"client"        = "m5n.8xlarge"
"prometheus"    = "c5.2xlarge"
}
num_instances = {
"client"     = 4
"redpanda"   = 3
"prometheus" = 1
}
```
====
.. From the Redpanda driver deployment directory, initialize the Terraform deployment of Redpanda on AWS.
+
[,bash]
----
cd driver-redpanda/deploy
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
----
+
NOTE: The `terraform apply` command prompts you for an owner name (`var.owner`) that is used to tag all the cloud resources that will be created. Once the installation is complete, you will see a confirmation message listing the resources that have been installed.
. Run the Ansible playbook to install and start the Redpanda cluster.
+
Redpanda can run with or without TLS and SASL enabled.

** To run Redpanda *without TLS and SASL*:
+
[,bash]
----
ansible-playbook deploy.yaml
----

** To run Redpanda *with TLS and SASL*:
+
[,bash]
----
ansible-playbook deploy.yaml -e "tls_enabled=true sasl_enabled=true"
----
+
If the path to your SSH private key isn't `~/.ssh/redpanda_aws`, add the `--private-key` flag to your Ansible command.
+
[,bash]
----
ansible-playbook deploy.yaml --private-key=<private-key-path>
----
+
NOTE: Beginning with Ansible 2.14, references to `args: warn` within Ansible tasks cause a fatal error and halt the execution of the playbook. You may find instances of this in the components installed by `ansible-galaxy`, particularly in the `cloudalchemy.grafana` task in `dashboards.yml`. To resolve this issue, removing the `warn` line in from the yml file.

== Run benchmark

Connect to the benchmark's client and run the benchmark with a custom workload.

. Connect with SSH to the benchmark client, with its IP address retrieved from the `client_ssh_host` output of Terraform.
+
[,bash]
----
ssh -i ~/.ssh/redpanda_aws ubuntu@$(terraform output --raw client_ssh_host)
----

. On the client, navigate to the `/opt/benchmark` directory.
+
[,bash]
----
cd /opt/benchmark
----

. Create a workload configuration file. For example, create a `.yaml` file with one topic, 144 partitions, 500 MBps producer rate, four producers, and and four consumers:
+
[,bash]
----
cat > workloads/1-topic-144-partitions-500mb-4p-4c.yaml << EOF
name: 500mb/sec rate; 4 producers 4 consumers; 1 topic with 144 partitions

topics: 1
partitionsPerTopic: 144

messageSize: 1024
useRandomizedPayloads: true
randomBytesRatio: 0.5
randomizedPayloadPoolSize: 1000

subscriptionsPerTopic: 1
consumerPerSubscription: 4
producersPerTopic: 4

producerRate: 500000

consumerBacklogSizeGB: 0
testDurationMinutes: 30
EOF
----
+
Alternatively, you can use an existing workload file from the Redpanda repo, in `openmessaging-benchmark/driver-redpanda/deploy/workloads/`.
+
.Workloads from Redpanda vs. Kafka comparison
[%collapsible]
====
The workloads from the https://redpanda.com/blog/redpanda-vs-kafka-performance-benchmark[Redpanda vs. Kafka benchmark comparison^] can be gotten from the chart in the comparison:

image::https://images.ctfassets.net/paqvtpyf8rwu/2lpkGM01nrl0s87xSBISno/6c25504b1f6e7c8015ef193433bd077e/kafka_vs_redpanda_performance_8.png[]
====

. Create or reuse a client configuration file. This file configures the Redpanda producer and consumer clients, as well as topics.
+
The rest of the guide uses the `openmessaging-benchmark/driver-redpanda/redpanda-ack-all-group-linger-1ms.yaml` configuration file.
+
.Client configuration from Redpanda vs. Kafka comparison
[%collapsible]
====
The client configuration from the https://redpanda.com/blog/redpanda-vs-kafka-performance-benchmark[Redpanda vs. Kafka benchmark comparison^] can be gotten from the code listing in the comparison:

```yaml
topicConfig: |
    min.insync.replicas=2
    flush.messages=1
    flush.ms=0
producerConfig: |
    acks=all
    linger.ms=1
    batch.size=131072
consumerConfig: |
    auto.offset.reset=earliest
    enable.auto.commit=false
    auto.commit.interval.ms=0
    max.partition.fetch.bytes=131072
```
====
+
TIP: Configure `reset=false` and manually delete the generated topic after the benchmark completes. Otherwise, when `reset=true`, the benchmark can fail due to it erroneously trying to delete the `_schemas` topic.

. Run the benchmark with your workload and client configuration.
+
[,bash]
----
sudo bin/benchmark -d \
driver-redpanda/redpanda-ack-all-group-linger-1ms.yaml \
workloads/1-topic-144-partitions-500mb-4p-4c.yaml
----

== View benchmark results

After a run completes, the benchmark generates results as `*.json` files in `/opt/benchmark`.

Redpanda provides a Python script, `generate_charts.py`, to generate charts of benchmark results. To run the script:

. Copy the results from the client to your local machine.
+
[,bash]
----
exit; # back to your local machine
mkdir ~/results
scp -i ~/.ssh/redpanda_aws ubuntu@$(terraform output --raw client_ssh_host):/opt/benchmark/*.json ~/results/
----

. From the root directory of the repository, install the prerequisite packages for the Python script.
+
[,bash]
----
cd ../../bin # openmessaging-benchmark/bin
python3 -m pip -r install requirements.txt
----

. To list all options, run the script with the `-h` flag.
+
[,bash]
----
./generate_charts.py -h
----

. To generate charts from your `~/results/` directory, first create an `~/output` directory, then run the script with `--results` and `--output` options set accordingly.
+
[,bash]
----
mkdir ~/output
./generate_charts.py --results ~/results --output ~/output
----

. In `~/output`, verify the generated charts are in an HTML page with charts for throughput, publish latency, end-to-end latency, publish rate, and consume rate.

== Tear down benchmark

When done running the benchmark, tear down the Redpanda cluster.

[,bash]
----
terraform destroy -auto-approve
----
