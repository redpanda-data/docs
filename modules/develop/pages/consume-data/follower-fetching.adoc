Learn about follower fetching and how to configure a Redpanda consumer to fetch records from the closest replica.

== About follower fetching

**Follower fetching** enables a consumer to fetch records from the closest replica of a topic partition, regardless of whether it's a leader or a follower.

For a Redpanda cluster deployed across different datacenters and availability zones (AZs), restricting a consumer to fetch only from the leader of a partition can incur greater costs and have higher latency than fetching from a follower that is geographically closer to the consumer.

With follower fetching (proposed in {url-kip392}[KIP-392^]), the fetch protocol is extended to support a consumer fetching from any replica.

The first fetch from a consumer is processed by a Redpanda leader node. The leader checks for a replica (itself or a follower) that has a rack ID that matches the consumer's rack ID. If a replica with a matching rack ID is found, the fetch request returns records from that replica. Otherwise, the fetch is handled by the leader.

== Configure follower fetching

Redpanda decides which replica a consumer fetches from. If the consumer configures its `client.rack` property, Redpanda by default selects a replica from the same rack as the consumer, if available.

To enable follower fetching in Redpanda, configure properties for the consumer and the Redpanda cluster and node:

[tabs]
====
Self-hosted::
+
--
- For a Redpanda cluster, set the xref:reference:cluster-properties.adoc#enable_rack_awareness[`enable_rack_awareness`] property to `true`.
- For each Redpanda node, set the xref:reference:node-properties.adoc#rack[`rack`] property to a rack ID.
- For each consumer, set the `client.rack` property to a rack ID.
--
Cloud::
+
--
For each consumer, set the `client.rack` property to a rack ID. xref:manage:rack-awareness.adoc[Rack awareness] is pre-enabled for cloud-based clusters in multi-AZ environments.
