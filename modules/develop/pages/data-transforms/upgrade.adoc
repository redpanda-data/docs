. Open your project's root directory.

. Run the following command to update the SDK:
+
```bash
go get github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/src/transform-sdk/go/transform@v<version>
```

. Clean up the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files:

. Open the `Cargo.toml` file in your project's root directory. This file specifies the dependencies for your Rust project.

. Locate the line that specifies the Redpanda SDK version. It will look something like this:
+
```toml
[dependencies]
redpanda-transform-sdk = "<version>"
```
. Change the version to the one you want to upgrade to.

. Run the following command to update the dependencies:
+
```bash
cargo update -p redpanda-transform-sdk
```

. Open the `package.json` file in your project's root directory.
. Locate the line that specifies the data transforms SDK version. It will look something like this:
+
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@redpanda-data/transform-sdk": "<version>"
  },
}
```
. Run the following command to update the SDK:
+
```bash
npm install --save @redpanda-data/transform-sdk@<version>
```
. Verify the update by checking the `package.json` file, the `package-lock.json` file, and the `node_modules/` directory.
