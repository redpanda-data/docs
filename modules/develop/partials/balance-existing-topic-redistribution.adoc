NOTE: If there are existing messages in a topic to which you wish to add partitions, be aware that there is no mechanism to redistribute those messages over to the newly-added partitions. If you require messages to be redistributed, then you must create a new topic with the new partition count, then stream the messages from the old topic to the new topic so they are appropriately distributed according to the new partition hashing.
