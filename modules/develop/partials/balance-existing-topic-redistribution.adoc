NOTE: If a topic already has messages and you add partitions, the existing messages wonâ€™t be redistributed to the new partitions.  If you require messages to be redistributed, then you must create a new topic with the new partition count, then stream the messages from the old topic to the new topic so they are appropriately distributed according to the new partition hashing.
