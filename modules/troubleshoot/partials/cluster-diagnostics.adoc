== Prerequisites

Before troubleshooting Redpanda, ensure that Kubernetes isn't the cause of the issue. For information about debugging applications in a Kubernetes cluster, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/[Kubernetes documentation^].
endif::[]

== Collect all debugging data

For a comprehensive diagnostic snapshot, generate a debug bundle that collects detailed data for cluster, broker, or node analysis.

See xref:{link-bundle}[] for details on generating a debug bundle.

== View Helm chart configuration

To check the overrides that were applied to your deployment:

[,bash]
----
helm get values <chart-name> --namespace <namespace>
----

If you're using the Redpanda Operator, the chart name matches the name of your Redpanda resource.

To check all the values that were set in the Redpanda Helm chart, including any overrides:

[,bash]
----
helm get values <chart-name> --namespace <namespace> --all
----

== View recent events

To understand the latest events that occurred in your Redpanda cluster's namespace, you can sort events by their creation timestamp:

[,bash]
----
kubectl get events --namespace <namespace> --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'
----

== View Redpanda logs

Logs are crucial for monitoring and troubleshooting your Redpanda clusters. Redpanda brokers output logs to STDOUT, making them accessible via `kubectl`.

To access logs for a specific Pod:

. List all Pods to find the names of those that are running Redpanda brokers:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods --namespace <namespace>
----

. View logs for a particular Pod by replacing `<pod-name>` with the name of your Pod:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl logs <pod-name> --namespace <namespace>
----
+
[TIP]
====
For a comprehensive overview, you can view aggregated logs from all Pods in the StatefulSet:

[,bash]
----
kubectl logs --namespace <namespace> -l app.kubernetes.io/component=redpanda-statefulset
----
====

=== Change the default log level

To change the default log level for all Redpanda subsystems, use the `logging.logLevel` configuration. Valid values are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.

Changing the default log level to `debug` can provide more detailed logs for diagnostics. This logging level increases the volume of generated logs.

NOTE: To set different log levels for individual subsystems, see <<Override the default log level for Redpanda subsystems>>.

+
[source,bash]
----
helm upgrade --install redpanda redpanda/redpanda --namespace <namespace> --create-namespace \
  --set logging.logLevel=debug
----
====
--
======

After applying these changes, verify the log level by <<view-redpanda-logs, checking the initial output of the logs>> for the Redpanda Pods.

=== Override the default log level for Redpanda subsystems

You can override the log levels for individual subsystems, such as `rpc` and `kafka`, for more detailed logging control. Overrides exist for the entire length of the running Redpanda process.

TIP: To temporarily override the log level for individual subsystems, you can use the xref:reference:rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-admin-config-log-level-set.adoc[`rpk redpanda admin config log-level set`] command.

. List all available subsystem loggers:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl exec -it --namespace <namespace> <pod-name> -c redpanda -- rpk redpanda start --help-loggers
----

. Set the log level for one or more subsystems. In this example, the `rpc` and `kafka` subsystem loggers are set to `debug`.

Overriding the log levels for specific subsystems provides enhanced visibility into Redpanda's internal operations, facilitating better debugging and monitoring.

== View Redpanda Operator logs

To learn what's happening with the Redpanda Operator and the associated Redpanda resources, you can inspect a combination of Kubernetes events and the resource manifests. By monitoring these events and resources, you can troubleshoot any issues that arise during the lifecycle of a Redpanda deployment.

[,bash]
----
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=operator -c manager --namespace <namespace>
----

=== Inspect Helm releases

The Redpanda Operator uses Flux to deploy the Redpanda Helm chart. By inspecting the `helmreleases.helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io` resource, you can get detailed information about the Helm installation process for your Redpanda resource:

[,bash]
----
kubectl get helmreleases.helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io -o yaml <redpanda-resource-name> --namespace <namespace>
----

To check the Redpanda resource:

[,bash]
----
kubectl get redpandas.cluster.redpanda.com -o yaml --namespace <namespace>
----

In both the HelmRelease and the Redpanda resource, the condition section reveals the ongoing status of the Helm installation. These conditions provide information on the success, failure, or pending status of various operations.

[[self-test]]
== Self-test benchmarks

When anomalous behavior arises in a cluster, you can determine if it's caused by issues with hardware, such as disk drives or network interfaces (NICs) by running xref:reference:rpk/rpk-cluster/rpk-cluster-self-test.adoc[`rpk cluster self-test`] to assess their performance and compare it to vendor specifications.

The `rpk cluster self-test` command runs a set of benchmarks to gauge the maximum performance of a machine's disks and network connections:

* **Disk tests**: Measures throughput and latency by performing concurrent sequential operations.
* **Network tests**: Selects unique pairs of Redpanda brokers as client/server pairs and runs throughput tests between them.

Each benchmark runs for a configurable duration and returns IOPS, throughput, and latency metrics. This helps you determine if hardware performance aligns with expected vendor specifications.

=== Cloud storage tests

You can also use the self-test command to confirm your cloud storage is configured correctly for xref:manage:tiered-storage.adoc[Tiered Storage].

Self-test performs the following checks to validate cloud storage configuration:

include::reference:partial$rpk-self-test-cloud-tests.adoc[]

For more information on cloud storage test details, see the xref:reference:rpk/rpk-cluster/rpk-cluster-self-test-start.adoc[`rpk cluster self-test start`] reference.

=== Start self-test

To start using self-test, run the `self-test start` command. Only initiate `self-test start` when system resources are available, as this operation can be resource-intensive.

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster self-test start
----

For command help, run `rpk cluster self-test start -h`. For additional command flags, see the xref:reference:rpk/rpk-cluster/rpk-cluster-self-test-start.adoc[rpk cluster self-test start] reference.

Before `self-test start` begins, it requests your confirmation to run its potentially large workload.

Example start output:

[.no-copy]
----
? Redpanda self-test will run benchmarks of disk and network hardware that will consume significant system resources. Do not start self-test if large workloads are already running on the system. (Y/n)
Redpanda self-test has started, test identifier: "031be460-246b-46af-98f2-5fc16f03aed3", To check the status run:
rpk cluster self-test status
----

The `self-test start` command returns immediately, and self-test runs its benchmarks asynchronously.

=== Check self-test status

To check the status of self-test, run the `self-test status` command.

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster self-test status
----

For command help, run `rpk cluster self-test status -h`. For additional command flags, see the xref:reference:rpk/rpk-cluster/rpk-cluster-self-test-status.adoc[rpk cluster self-test status] reference.

If benchmarks are currently running, `self-test status` returns a test-in-progress message.

Example status output:

[.no-copy]
----
$ rpk cluster self-test status
Nodes [0 1 2] are still running jobs
----

[TIP]
====
The `status` command can output results in JSON format for automated checks or script integration. Use the `--format=json` option:

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster self-test status --format=json
----
====

If benchmarks have completed, `self-test status` returns their results.

include::reference:partial$rpk-self-test-descriptions.adoc[]

.Example status output: test results
include::reference:partial$rpk-self-test-status-output.adoc[]

=== Stop self-test

To stop a running self-test, run the `self-test stop` command.

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster self-test stop
----

Example stop output:

[.no-copy]
----
$ rpk cluster self-test stop
All self-test jobs have been stopped
----

For command help, run `rpk cluster self-test stop -h`. For additional command flags, see the xref:reference:rpk/rpk-cluster/rpk-cluster-self-test-stop.adoc[rpk cluster self-test stop] reference.

For more details about self-test, including command flags, see xref:reference:rpk/rpk-cluster/rpk-cluster-self-test.adoc[rpk cluster self-test].
