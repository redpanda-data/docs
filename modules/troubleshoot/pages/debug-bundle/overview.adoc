= Debug Bundles Overview
:description: Learn about debug bundles, their use cases, and how to manage them for effective Redpanda cluster diagnostics.

A debug bundle is a collection of diagnostic data from your Redpanda cluster. It includes logs, metrics, and other critical information that helps diagnose and troubleshoot cluster issues.

Debug bundles are designed to:

- Provide a consolidated view of cluster health and activity.
- Help identify and resolve issues such as crashes, resource bottlenecks, or misconfigurations.
- Facilitate communication with Redpanda support by enabling you to share detailed diagnostic data.

== Tools for managing debug bundles

You can create and manage debug bundles using the following tools:

- Redpanda Console: A user-friendly web UI for generating and downloading debug bundles without needing direct broker access.
- `rpk`: A command-line tool that provides options for generating bundles either locally or remotely.

== Contents of the debug bundle

The files and directories in the debug bundle differ depending on the environment in which Redpanda is running.
