= Add a BYOC VPC Peering Connection on GCP
:description: Use the Redpanda and GCP UIs to create a VPC peering connection for a BYOC cluster.
:page-cloud: true

To start sending data to the Redpanda cluster, you must configure the VPC network connection by connecting your Redpanda VPC to your existing GCP VPC.

== Prerequisites

* A GCP account
* A running BYOC cluster in GCP. See xref:get-started:cluster-types/byoc/create-byoc-cluster-gcp.adoc[Create a BYOC Cluster on GCP].
* Your Redpanda cluster and VPC must be in the same region.

== Create VPCs

. Go to the *VPC* section in your GCP project UI.
. You should see an existing VPC. This has an ID with a `redpanda-` prefix.
. If you don't already have a second VPC to connect your Redpanda network to, create one.
* This is your Redpanda client. Ensure that its CIDR does not overlap with the Redpanda network from step 1.
* The following example uses the name `rp-client`.

== Create a new peering connection

. In the GCP project UI, go to *Peering Connections*.
. Create a new peering connection with the following values:
* Your VPC network: `rp-client`
* Peered VPC network: `redpanda-<id>`
. Save changes.
. Create another peering connection, with the reverse values as above:
* Your VPC network: `redpanda-<id>`
* Peered VPC network: `rp-client`
. Save changes. GCP should set up routing automatically.

== Connect to Redpanda

The cluster Overview page has a variety of ways for you to connect and start sending data.

To quickly test this quickly in GCP:

* Create a virtual machine on your GCP network that has a firewall rule allowing ingress traffic from your IP (for example, `<your-ip>/32`)
* Activate the Cloud Shell in your project, install `rpk` in the Cloud Shell, and run `rpk cluster info`.
* If there is output from Redpanda, your connection is successful.
