Spin up a Redpanda cluster with Redpanda Cloud, create a basic streaming application using the rpk command-line tool, and explore your cluster in Redpanda Console.

Redpanda Cloud is a fully managed Redpanda cluster hosted on dedicated resources and configurable instance types.

== Prerequisites

https://redpanda.com/try-redpanda?section=cloud-trial[Sign up for a trial] of Redpanda Cloud - Dedicated Clusters.

== Deploy Redpanda

To deploy a Redpanda cluster in the Dedicated cloud, create a namespace, then follow the steps for creating a Dedicated cluster.

To create a namespace:

include::deploy:partial$deployment-option/cloud/dedicated/create-namespace.adoc[]

To create a cluster:

. Click **Add Cluster**.

. Click **Create Dedicated cluster**, and enter the following values:
+
- **Cluster name**:
+
[,plain,role=no-copy]
----
redpandaquickstart
----

- **Throughput**: 1 MBps

- **Version**: Choose the latest available version

. Click **Next** to see the **Cloud settings** options, and enter the following values:
+
- **Provider**: AWS

- **Region**: Any region that's closest to you

- **Availability**: Single AZ

- **Select a zone**: Choose any zone

. Click **Next** to see the **Networking** options, and enter the following values:
+
- **Connection Type**: Public Network

. Click **Create**.

. Wait for both your network and your cluster to be created.

== Start streaming

To start building a basic streaming application, you can use rpk to create a topic, produce messages to it, and consume messages from it.
rpk is a command-line tool for connecting to and interacting with Redpanda brokers.

. Install rpk on your local machine:
+
NOTE: The `rpk` binary is not supported on Windows.
+

Linux::

include::partial$install-rpk-linux.adoc[]
--
macOS::

include::get-started:partial$install-rpk-homebrew.adoc[]
--
======

. On the **Overview** page of Redpanda Cloud, copy your bootstrap server address and set it as an environment variable on your local machine:
+
```bash
export REDPANDA_BROKERS="<bootstrap-server-address>"
```

. In Redpanda Cloud, go to **Security** and create a user called **redpanda-chat-account** that uses the SCRAM-SHA-256 mechanism.

. Copy the password, and set the following environment variables on your local machine:
+
```bash
export REDPANDA_SASL_USERNAME="redpanda-chat-account"
export REDPANDA_SASL_PASSWORD="<password>"
export REDPANDA_SASL_MECHANISM="SCRAM-SHA-256"
```

. In Redpanda Cloud, click the name of your user and add the following permissions to the ACL (access control list):
+
- **Host**: *
- **Topic name**:
+
[,plain,role=no-copy]
----
chat-room
----

- **Operations**: All

. Use rpk on your local machine to authenticate to Redpanda as the redpanda-chat-account user and get information about the cluster:
+
```bash
rpk cluster info --tls-enabled
```

. Create a topic called `chat-room`.
+
You granted permissions to the **redpanda-chat-account** user to access only this topic.
+
```bash
rpk topic create chat-room --tls-enabled
```
+
Output:
+
[,plain,role=no-copy]
----
TOPIC       STATUS
chat-room  OK
----

. Produce a message to the topic:
+
```bash
rpk topic produce chat-room --tls-enabled
```

. Enter a message, then press kbd:[Enter]:
+
```text
Pandas are fabulous!
```
+
Example output:
+
[,plain,role=no-copy]
----
Produced to partition 0 at offset 0 with timestamp 1663282629789.
----

. Press kbd:[Ctrl + C] to finish producing messages to the topic.

. Consume one message from the topic:
+
```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic consume chat-room --num 1
```
+
Your message is displayed along with its metadata,:
+
```json
{
  "topic": "chat-room",
  "value": "Pandas are fabulous!",
  "timestamp": 1663282629789,
  "partition": 0,
  "offset": 0
}
```

== Explore your topic

In Redpanda Cloud, go to **Topics** > **chat-room**.

The message that you produced to the topic is displayed along with some other details about the topic.

== Clean up

If you don't want to continue experimenting with your cluster, you can delete it.

Go to **Cluster settings** and click **Delete cluster**.
