:description: Summary of new features and updates in the release.

This topic includes new content added in version 24.1 beta. 

== Write caching

xref:develop:config-topics.adoc#configure-write-caching[Write caching] is a relaxed mode of `acks=all` that provides better performance at the expense of durability. It acknowledges a message as soon as it is received and acknowledged on a majority of brokers, without waiting for it to fsync to disk. This provides lower latency while still ensuring that a majority of brokers acknowledge the write. For clusters in development mode, write caching is enabled by default. For clusters in production mode, it is disabled by default.

== RBAC
xref:manage:security/authorization/rbac.adoc[Role-based access control] (RBAC) provides an extension to Redpanda's existing access control lists (ACLs). It allows you to create roles and assign those roles as the authorized or denied party for an ACL. Every user you assign to that role inherits those authorizations. Using RBAC gives you a more flexible and more efficient tool to manage authorization for your users, especially when you have complex organizational hierarchies, large numbers of users, or both.  

== Data transforms

* Output to multiple topics: Data transforms can now output to multiple topics, for use cases that might require distributing different message types to multiple event streams, or for writing valid records to an output topic and invalid records to a dead-letter queue. See the xref:reference:data-transform-golang-sdk.adoc[Go] or xref:reference:data-transform-rust-sdk.adoc[Rust] SDK reference for data transforms for implementation details.

* Transform logs stored in topic xref:develop:data-transforms/run-transforms.adoc#view-data-transform-logs[data transform logs] are now stored in an internally-managed topic.

== New commands

The following `rpk` commands are new in this release:

- xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security.adoc[`rpk security`]
- xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security-role.adoc[`rpk security role`]
- xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security-role-assign.adoc[`rpk security role assign`]
- xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security-role-create.adoc[`rpk security role create`]
- xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security-role-delete.adoc[`rpk security role delete`]
- xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security-role-describe.adoc[`rpk security role describe`]
- xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security-role-list.adoc[`rpk security role list`]
- xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security-role-unassign.adoc[`rpk security role unassign`]

Additionally, to bundle security commands together, the existing `rpk acl` commands moved into this new section as xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security-acl.adoc[`rpk security acl`]. The existing `rpk acl` commands still works as an alias.
