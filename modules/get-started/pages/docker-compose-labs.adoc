// This page looks empty because the list of labs isn't hardcoded here.
// Instead, the `generate-index-data` extension dynamically gathers all Docker Compose labs
// from the `redpanda-labs` component during the Antora build process.
// It then assigns the resulting JSON data to the `docker-labs-index` attribute.
//
// The UI template checks the `:index-data:` attribute on this page and includes a predefined partial
// that transforms this JSON data into a rendered list of links and descriptions.
//
// As a result, you define the role and index-data attribute here, and the extension/UI
// handle the rest. This approach keeps the source clean and easy to maintain,
// even as the number of labs grows or changes over time.
