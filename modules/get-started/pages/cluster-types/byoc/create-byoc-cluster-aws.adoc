To create a Redpanda cluster in your virtual private cloud (VPC), log in to https://cloud.redpanda.com[Redpanda Cloud^]. 

== Create a BYOC cluster

. On the Clusters page, click *Create cluster*, then click *Create BYOC cluster*.
. Enter a cluster name, then select the resource group, provider (AWS), xref:reference:tiers/byoc-tiers.adoc[region, availability zones, tier], and Redpanda version.
+
[NOTE]
==== 
* If you plan to create a private network in your own VPC, select the region where your VPC is located.
* Three availability zones provide two backups in case one availability zone goes down.
====
+ 
Optionally, click *Advanced settings* to specify up to five key-value custom tags. After the cluster is created, the tags are applied to all AWS resources associated with this cluster. For more information, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconnect/latest/ug/tagging-restrictions.html[AWS documentation^].

. Click *Next*.
. On the Network page, enter the connection type: either *Public* or *Private*. For BYOC clusters, *Private* is best-practice.
** Your network name is used to identify this network.
** For a xref:networking:cidr-ranges.adoc[CIDR range], choose one that does not overlap with your existing VPCs or your Redpanda network.
. Click *Next*.
. On the Deploy page, follow the steps to log in to Redpanda Cloud and deploy the agent.
+
As part of agent deployment, Redpanda assigns the permission required to run the agent. For details about these permissions, see xref:security:authorization/cloud-iam-policies.adoc#aws-iam-policies[AWS IAM policies].
