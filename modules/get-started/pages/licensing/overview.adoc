Redpanda, Redpanda Console, and Redpanda Connect are available in community and enterprise editions. Each product has a single binary that supports both editions.

* Redpanda Community Edition is free and source-available on GitHub:
** https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda[Redpanda^]
** https://github.com/redpanda-data/console[Redpanda Console^]
** https://github.com/redpanda-data/connect[Redpanda Connect^]
* Redpanda Enterprise Edition requires a license key and includes additional features.

[NOTE]
====
Redpanda Cloud is a managed deployment of Redpanda Enterprise Edition. To learn more about Redpanda Cloud, see the xref:redpanda-cloud:get-started:cloud-overview.adoc[].

== Community Edition

The Community Edition is licensed with the Redpanda https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/blob/dev/licenses/bsl.md[Business Source License^] (BSL). These core features are free and source-available.

=== Restrictions and licensing terms

* Users cannot provide Redpanda as a commercial streaming or queuing service to others.
* The BSL code converts to Apache 2.0 licensing four years after each code merge.

== Enterprise Edition

The Enterprise Edition is licensed with the https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/blob/dev/licenses/rcl.md[Redpanda Community License^] (RCL). It includes the free features licensed under the Redpanda BSL, as well as enterprise features.

=== License keys

Enterprise features require an Enterprise Edition license key, sometimes referred to as enterprise license, license key, or license.

Starting with version 24.3, new Redpanda clusters automatically receive a trial license that's valid for 30 days, allowing unrestricted use of enterprise features. This evaluation period begins when the cluster is created for the first time. After this period expires, inactive enterprise features are disabled, and active features enter a restricted state.

To get a trial license key or extend your trial period, https://redpanda.com/try-enterprise[generate a new trial license key]. Or, https://redpanda.com/upgrade[upgrade to Redpanda Enterprise^].

=== Redpanda enterprise features

The following table lists the Enterprise features for Redpanda and how Redpanda behaves upon license expiration when each enterprise feature is enabled.

- *Upon license expiration*:

** The cluster continues to operate without data loss, but the further use of enterprise features is restricted (see the <<redpanda-enterprise-features, table 1>>).
** Configuration of enterprise features remains unchanged, allowing you to add a new license and continue using enterprise features as before expiration. For instructions, see xref:get-started:licensing/add-license-redpanda/index.adoc[]

- *After license expiration*: You cannot enable enterprise features without a valid license.
