== Community Edition

The Community Edition is licensed with the Redpanda https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/blob/dev/licenses/bsl.md[Business Source License^] (BSL). These core features are free and source-available.

[NOTE]
====
* Users cannot provide Redpanda as a commercial streaming or queuing service to others.
* The BSL code converts to Apache 2.0 licensing four years after each code merge.
====

== Enterprise Edition

The Enterprise Edition is licensed with the https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/blob/dev/licenses/rcl.md[Redpanda Community License^] (RCL). It includes the free features licensed under the Redpanda BSL, as well as enterprise features.

=== License keys

Enterprise features require an Enterprise Edition license key, sometimes referred to as Enterprise license, license key, or license.

Starting with version 24.3, new Redpanda clusters automatically receive a trial license that's valid for 45 days, allowing unrestricted use of Enterprise features. This evaluation period begins when the cluster is created for the first time. After this period expires, inactive Enterprise features are disabled, and active features enter a restricted state.

To request a trial license key, to extend your trial period, or to purchase a license, contact https://redpanda.com/try-redpanda?section=enterprise-trial[Redpanda Sales^].

* xref:console:config/security/authentication.adoc[Redpanda Console Authentication]
* xref:console:config/security/authorization.adoc[Redpanda Console Authorization (RBAC)]


[[connect]]
=== Enterprise features in Redpanda Connect

== How Redpanda Console handles licenses

If Redpanda Console cannot find a valid license either locally or in the connected Redpanda cluster, it shuts down. Redpanda Console tries to load a valid license at startup in the following order:

. From the local configuration file or environment variables.
. From the connected Redpanda cluster (if available).

Redpanda Console displays warnings in the following scenarios:

- *Upcoming license expiration*: Redpanda Console checks the license status at startup. If the license expires within 30 days, a warning is displayed in the UI. Redpanda Console also logs the license details at startup, including the expiration date. For example:
+
[,json]
----
{"level":"info","msg":"successfully loaded Redpanda Enterprise license","license_org":"redpanda","license_type":"enterprise","expires_at":"Oct 12 2024"}
----

- *Redpanda Self-Managed enterprise features are in use without a valid license*: If the Redpanda cluster is using enterprise features without a valid license, Redpanda Console displays a warning specifying the features in use without proper licensing.

- *Redpanda Console enterprise features in use without a valid license*: If you configure enterprise features in Redpanda Console without a valid license, Redpanda Console shuts down and logs a warning.

=== Ways to manage licenses for Redpanda Console

Redpanda Console offers two methods for applying or updating a license, depending on your setup:

- If you are using Redpanda Console without connecting it to a Redpanda cluster, you can xref:console:config/enterprise-license.adoc[configure the license through the local configuration file or environment variables]. This method allows you to add a license for Redpanda Console independently of the Redpanda cluster.

- If Redpanda Console is connected to a Redpanda cluster, you can xref:console:ui/add-license.adoc[upload a license through the Redpanda Console UI]. This method allows you to manage and update licenses for both Redpanda Console and the connected Redpanda cluster.
