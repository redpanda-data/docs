== Community Edition

The Community Edition is licensed with the Redpanda https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/blob/dev/licenses/bsl.md[Business Source License^] (BSL). These core features are free and source-available.

=== Restrictions and licensing terms

* Users cannot provide Redpanda as a commercial streaming or queuing service to others.
* The BSL code converts to Apache 2.0 licensing four years after each code merge.

== Enterprise Edition

The Enterprise Edition is licensed with the https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/blob/dev/licenses/rcl.md[Redpanda Community License^] (RCL). It includes the free features licensed under the Redpanda BSL, as well as enterprise features.
You can also generate a <<Trial license>> for the Enterprise Edition.

=== Trial license

All new Redpanda clusters automatically receive a trial license that's valid for 30 days. If you wish to extend this trial an additional 30 days, use the xref:reference:rpk/rpk-generate/rpk-generate-license.adoc[`rpk generate license`] command. This extended evaluation period begins after you apply the trial license to your cluster using the `--apply` flag. After this period expires, inactive enterprise features are disabled, and active features enter a restricted state.

IMPORTANT: Only one trial license is permitted per email and business domain. Attempts to generate multiple trial licenses from the same email or business domain result in a license error. To get a permanent license, contact https://www.redpanda.com/contact[Redpanda Sales^].

To generate and apply a 30-day trial license for Enterprise Edition:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----

rpk generate license --apply
First Name: <your_first_name>
Last Name: <your_last_name>
Company name: <your company name>
Email: <your business email address>

Successfully saved license to "/home/<your local directory>/code/rp/redpanda/src/go/rpk/redpanda.license".

Upload this license in Redpanda Console, or run:
  rpk cluster license set --path /home/<your local directory>/rp/redpanda/src/go/rpk/redpanda.license

This license expires on 2025-05-07.

For more information, see:
  https://docs.redpanda.com/current/get-started/licensing/overview/#license-keys
----

NOTE: To activate the trial license, you must apply it to your cluster using the `--apply` flag. The trial license is saved in your working directory or the specified path, based on the `--path` flag.

Optionally, you can https://redpanda.com/try-enterprise[request a new trial license key] to extend your trial period.

=== License keys

Enterprise features require an Enterprise Edition license key, sometimes called enterprise license, license key, or license.

- **Redpanda**: Starting with version 24.3, new Redpanda clusters automatically receive a trial license that's valid for 30 days, allowing unrestricted use of enterprise features. This evaluation period begins when the cluster is created for the first time. After this period expires, inactive enterprise features are disabled, and active features enter a restricted state.
+
To extend your trial license see <<Trial license>>, https://redpanda.com/try-enterprise[request a new trial license key], or https://redpanda.com/upgrade[upgrade to Redpanda Enterprise^].
+
include::get-started:partial$licensing/block-upgrades-note.adoc[]
+
IMPORTANT: To avoid startup issues with Redpanda Console when a trial or Enterprise license expires, use Redpanda Console v2.8.3 or later with clusters running Redpanda 24.3 or later.

- **Redpanda Connect**: To evaluate enterprise features in Redpanda Connect, you must xref:redpanda-connect:get-started:licensing.adoc#apply-a-license-key-to-redpanda-connect[apply a trial license key]. After the 30-day evaluation period, you are blocked from using enterprise connectors unless you https://www.redpanda.com/upgrade[upgrade to an Enterprise Edition license^].

=== Redpanda enterprise features

The following table lists the enterprise features for Redpanda and how Redpanda behaves upon license expiration when each enterprise feature is enabled.

- *Upon license expiration*:

** The cluster continues to operate without data loss, but the further use of enterprise features is restricted (see the <<redpanda-enterprise-features, table 1>>).
** Configuration of enterprise features remains unchanged, allowing you to add a new license and continue using enterprise features as before expiration. For instructions, see xref:get-started:licensing/add-license-redpanda/index.adoc[]
