= Check License Status and Feature Usage with Redpanda Operator
:env-kubernetes: true
:description: Learn how to monitor the status of an Enterprise Edition license and enterprise feature usage in Kubernetes using the Redpanda Operator.

If your Redpanda cluster is deployed in Kubernetes using the Redpanda Operator, you can monitor the license status from the Redpanda custom resource. The operator integrates license monitoring into the resource's `status.conditions` and `status.license` fields, allowing you to get the license state with `kubectl`. These fields provide a detailed overview of your Redpanda license, including its status, expiration, and enterprise features currently in use.

. Identify your Redpanda resources:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl get redpanda -A
----
+
Example output:
+
[.no-copy]
----
NAMESPACE   NAME      LICENSE       READY   STATUS
redpanda    cluster   Valid         True    Redpanda reconciliation succeeded
----
+
The `License` field indicates whether the license is valid. Possible values include:
+
- `Valid`: The license is valid.
- `Expired`: The license has expired.
- `Not Present`: No license is applied.

. List detailed information about the license on a particular cluster:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl get redpanda <resource-name> -o jsonpath='{.status.license}'
----
+
Replace `<resource-name>` with the name of your Redpanda resource, such as `example-redpanda`.
+
The output depends on the license status. It can include the following:

== Examples

This section provides examples of what the operator reports depending on the license status.

Valid license:

[source,json]
----
{
  "license": {
    "status": "valid",
    "violation": false,
    "inUseFeatures": ["partition_auto_balancing_continuous"],
    "organization": "Devex",
    "type": "enterprise",
    "expiration": "2025-10-11T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
----

Without a license:

[source,json]
----
{
  "license": {
    "status": "not_present",
    "violation": false,
    "inUseFeatures": ["partition_auto_balancing_continuous"]
  }
}
----

Expired license:

[source,json]
----
{
  "license": {
    "status": "expired",
    "violation": true,
    "inUseFeatures": ["partition_auto_balancing_continuous"],
  }
}
----


== Trigger license checks

The Redpanda Operator performs a license check during reconciliation, which is triggered in the following cases:

- If changes are made to the Redpanda resource or its status.

- If changes are made to resources managed by the operator, such as the StatefulSet resources for brokers or Deployment resources for Redpanda Console.

- If no changes occur, the operator reconciles every 10 hours (default cache resync interval).

- If you force reconciliation by making a no-op change, such as adding an annotation, to the Redpanda resource.
