= Monitor the Status of an Enterprise Edition License
:description: pass:q[Learn how to monitor the status of your Redpanda Enterprise Edition license using `rpk`, the Redpanda Console, the Admin API, and observability tools such as logs and metrics.]

To track license expiration and ensure compliance with xref:get-started:licensing/overview.adoc[Redpanda licensing], you can monitor the status of your Enterprise Edition license using <<rpk, `rpk`>>, the <<admin, Admin API>>, <<console, Redpanda Console>>, and observability tools such as <<logs, logs>> and <<metrics, metrics>>.

[[rpk]]
== Check the status of a license with `rpk`

To check the status of your current license, use the `rpk cluster license info` command. You can choose different output formats depending on your use case.

. Make sure that xref:get-started:rpk-install.adoc[`rpk` is installed] and configured to connect to your cluster's Admin API endpoint.

. Get the details about your cluster's license:
+
```bash
rpk cluster license info
```
+
The output displays the following details:
+
----
Organization:    Organization the license was generated for.
Type:            Type of license.
Expires:         Expiration date of the license.
Version:         License schema version.
----
+
If the license is within 30 days of expiration, a warning is logged:
+
----
warning: your license will expire soon
----

=== Change the output format

Different output formats can be useful depending on your scenario. The available formats include JSON, YAML, text, and wide (expanded). For example, if you are writing scripts or automating license monitoring, you may prefer the JSON format, as it's easily parsed by tools like `jq` or integrated into monitoring systems.

To get the license information in another format, use the `--format` flag:

```bash
rpk cluster license info --format <format>
```

Replace `<format>` with one of the available formats. See xref:reference:rpk/rpk-cluster/rpk-cluster-license-info.adoc[].

For more details, including the SHA-256 checksum and Unix timestamp for expiration, use the `wide` format. This format is useful when you need a deeper level of detail about the license for troubleshooting or verification. For example:

----
LICENSE INFORMATION
Organization:      Your Organization
Type:              enterprise
Expires:           Jan 1 2025
License Expired:   false
Checksum:          3d2e5b4d07d294534d9b7e90d8f73e91d34f7b4a62c45b6dc1c1e6f9d0a12bcf
ExpiresUnix:       1735689600
----

[[admin]]
== Check the status of a license with the Admin API

You can retrieve the license status and information about in-use enterprise features using the Redpanda Admin API. This API provides JSON-formatted responses and is useful for programmatic access to the license details and feature status.

To get the license status and features in use, make a `GET` request to the `/v1/features/enterprise` endpoint. For example:

[,bash]
----
curl -X GET http://<redpanda-host>:<port>/v1/features/enterprise
----

Example response:

[,json]
----
{
  "license_status": "valid",
  "violation": false,
  "features": [
    {
      "name": "audit_logging",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "name": "tiered_storage",
      "enabled": false
    }
  ]
}
----

- `license_status`: The status of the license. Possible values are:
** `valid`: The license is valid.
** `expired`: The license has expired.
** `not_present`: No license is present.

- `violation`: A boolean value that indicates whether there is a violation. For example, the license is not valid and one or more enterprise features are enabled.

- `features`: An array of enterprise features that lists each feature by name and whether it is enabled (`true`) or not (`false`).

NOTE: The returned enterprise features are specific to Redpanda Enterprise Edition. They do not include xref:get-started:licensing/overview.adoc#connect[enterprise features for Redpanda Connect] or xref:get-started:licensing/overview.adoc#console[enterprise features in Redpanda Console].

[[console]]
== Check the status of a license in Redpanda Console

You can also check the status of your license in the Redpanda Console UI. See xref:console:ui/add-license.adoc[].

[[logs]]
== Monitor a license in the logs

Logs are emitted on Redpanda brokers to help you understand how the license is being applied and when enforcement actions are triggered.

[[metrics]]
== Monitor a license using metrics

The xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc#redpanda_cluster_features_enterprise_license_expiry_sec[`redpanda_cluster_features_enterprise_license_expiry_sec`] metric tells you how many seconds remain until the license expires. Use this metric to set up alerts or dashboards to track the license expiration status and ensure timely renewal.
