// (step {"action":"wait", "duration": 10000})

When the containers are running, you have:

- A Redpanda cluster with a 30-day free trial license.
- A running data streaming pipeline generating data into the `logins` and `transactions` topics.
- A Wasm data transform processing data from `logins` into `edu-filtered-domains`.
- A secured instance of Redpanda Console with login authentication.

== Explore Redpanda Console

Redpanda Console is a developer-friendly web UI for managing and debugging your Redpanda cluster and your applications. This section provides practical examples and scenarios to help you understand how to leverage Redpanda Console for different use cases, including data observability, Redpanda management, access control, and connectivity.

Redpanda Console was deployed as part of the `docker-compose.yml` file and is running locally on port 8080.

=== Log in to Redpanda Console

Redpanda Console is configured with plain login credentials (enterprise feature) for an admin user called `jane`. To start using Redpanda Console, you first need to log in with the credentials defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8080/login.
. Enter the following credentials:
+
--
- Username: `jane`
- Password: `some-other-secret-password`
--
+
This user is an admin user that has access to all features, including the Admin panel.

You should now see an overview of your cluster's status, health, and broker details.

// (step {"action":"checkLink", "url": "http://localhost:8080"})
// (step {"action":"goTo", "url": "http://localhost:8080/login"})
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='auth-username-input']", "typeKeys": "jane", "click": true})
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='auth-password-input']", "typeKeys": "some-other-secret-password", "click": true})

image::console:broker-overview.png[]

See also: xref:console:config/security/plain.adoc[].

=== View topics and filter messages

This deployment comes with two pre-configured topics, `logins` and `transactions`, which are actively receiving data as part of a data pipeline deployed through Redpanda Connect. These topics simulate real-world data flows, enabling you to explore and interact with Redpanda Console features.

You can filter messages in topics using several methods:

- Text search: Search for specific text within the message.
- Partition offset filters: Set the start and end offsets to narrow down the message range.
- JavaScript filters: Use JavaScript function bodies to create complex filters that run server-side.

Suppose you're asked to find all transactions related to the `.edu` domain. You can use a JavaScript filter to display only messages that include email addresses in that domain.

. In the left menu, click *Topics*.
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='nav-link-Topics']", "matchText": "Topics", "click": true})
. Click the *transactions* topic. When the topic's page opens, the *Messages* tab is selected by default.
// (step {"action":"goTo", "url": "http://localhost:8080/topics/transactions"})
// (step {"action":"wait"})
. Click *Add filter* > *JavaScript Filter*.
// (step {"action":"saveScreenshot", "path": "topic.png", "directory": "../../modules/console/images", "overwrite": "byVariation"})
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='add-topic-filter']", "matchText": "Add filter", "click": true, "timeout": 10000})
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='add-topic-filter-javascript']", "matchText": "JavaScript Filter", "click": true, "timeout": 10000})
. Give your filter a name, such as "Find .edu domains".
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='add-javascript-filter-name']", "typeKeys": "Find .edu domains", "click": true, "timeout": 10000})
// (step {"action":"saveScreenshot", "path": "js-filter.png", "directory": "../../modules/console/images", "overwrite": "byVariation", "maxVariation": 10})
+
image::console:js-filter.png[]

. Replace the default JavaScript code with the following:
+
[,js]
----
return value.email.includes(".edu");
----

. Click *Save* to apply the filter.
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='add-javascript-filter-save']", "matchText": "Save", "click": true})
+
You should see only messages that include the specific domain.

By default, the filter runs on the newest 50 messages. You can run the filter on older messages by changing the start offset. For example, to start from the oldest messages, select *Oldest*.
// (step {"action":"goTo", "url": "http://localhost:8080/topics/transactions"})
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": ".chakra-tabs__tablist button[data-index='5']", "matchText": "Documentation", "click": true})
// (step {"action":"wait"})
// (step {"action":"saveScreenshot", "path": "topic-documentation.png", "directory": "../../modules/console/images", "overwrite": "byVariation"})

=== Schema Registry

On the *Schema Registry* page, you see an overview of your schemas. You can create, manage, and inspect your schemas without leaving Redpanda Console.

// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='nav-link-Schema Registry']", "matchText": "Schema Registry", "click": true})
// (step {"action":"goTo", "url": "http://localhost:8080/schema-registry/subjects/transactions?version=latest"})
// (step {"action":"wait"})
// (step {"action":"saveScreenshot", "path": "schema-reg.png", "directory": "../../modules/console/images", "overwrite": "byVariation"})

image::console:schema-reg.png[]

See also: xref:console:ui/schema-reg.adoc[].

=== Configure access control for Redpanda

Managing access control lists (ACLs) can be complex, but Redpanda Console simplifies this with an intuitive interface.

This quickstart deployment includes a bootstrapped superuser with full administrative privileges. The superuser has unrestricted access to all topics, consumer groups, transactions, and cluster-level operations. By default, the credentials for the superuser are:

- Username: `superuser`
- Password: `secretpassword`

For improved security and role-based access control, you should create additional users with restricted permissions as needed.

On the *Security* page, you can:

- Create, view, and edit ACLs for topics, consumer groups, transactions, and the entire cluster.
- Quickly understand what each principal (user) is authorized to do.

Suppose you're onboarding a new team member who needs access to specific topics and consumer groups. You can use Redpanda Console to ensure users have the right permissions to perform their tasks.

. In the left menu, click *Security*.
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='nav-link-Security']", "matchText": "Security", "click": true})
. On the *Users* tab, click *Create user*.
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='create-user-button']", "matchText": "Create user", "click": true})
. Enter "Sasha" in the username field.
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='create-user-name']", "typeKeys": "Sasha", "click": true})
. Enter "sashapassword" in the password field.
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='password-input-toggle']", "click": true})
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='test_field']", "setVariables": [{"name": "password","regex": ".*"}], "click": true})
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='password-input-toggle']", "click": true})
// (step {"action":"wait"})
// (step {"action":"saveScreenshot", "path": "user.png", "directory": "../../modules/console/images", "overwrite": "byVariation"})
. Click *Create*.

image::console:user.png[]

You now have a new user called Sasha. But this user has no permissions yet. To set permissions on the `transactions` topic:

. Back on the Access control page, go to the *ACLs* tab.
. Select *Sasha* and click *Create ACL*.
. In the topic selector dropdown, select *Literal* and enter "transactions" in the input field.
. Under *Operations*, click the *All* dropdown and select *Allow*.
. Scroll down and click *OK*.

Now Sasha has full access only to the topic called transactions.

To test these permissions, use `rpk` to connect to Redpanda as the user Sasha.

. Try to access the `logins` topic as Sasha:
+
[,bash]
----
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic describe logins \
  -X user=Sasha \
  -X pass=sashapassword \
  -X sasl.mechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256 \
  -X brokers=redpanda-0:9092
----
+
You are not authorized to view the topic.
+
[.no-copy]
----
SUMMARY
=======
NAME        logins
PARTITIONS  0
ERROR       TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED: Not authorized to access topics: [Topic authorization failed.]

CONFIGS
=======
config response contained error: TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED: Not authorized to access topics: [Topic authorization failed.]
----

. Now try to access the `transactions` topic as Sasha:
+
[,bash]
----
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic describe transactions \
  -X user=Sasha \
  -X pass=sashapassword \
  -X sasl.mechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256 \
  -X brokers=redpanda-0:9092
----
+
You have access to this topic.

=== Data transforms

Data transforms let you run common data streaming tasks on the Redpanda broker, like filtering, scrubbing, and transcoding. For example, you may have consumers that require you to redact credit card numbers or convert JSON to Avro.

This deployment comes with one transform function called `regex` running in your cluster. Its job is to find records in the `logins` topic that contain email addresses with the `.edu` domain and add those to a new topic called `edu-filtered-domains`.

In the left menu, click *Transforms*.
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='nav-link-Transforms']", "matchText": "Transforms", "click": true})

On the *Transforms* page, you see your transform. You can use Redpanda Console to manage and monitor your transforms.
// (step {"action":"wait"})
// (step {"action":"saveScreenshot", "path": "transforms.png", "directory": "../../modules/console/images", "overwrite": "byVariation"})

NOTE: The source code for the data transform function is in the `docker-compose/transform/transform.go` file that you downloaded. This file is commented to explain how it works.

image::console:transforms.png[]

// (step {"action":"goTo", "url": "http://localhost:8080/admin/upload-license"})
// (step {"action":"wait"})
// (step {"action":"saveScreenshot", "path": "license.png", "directory": "../../modules/console/images", "overwrite": "byVariation"})

== Start streaming

To start building a basic streaming application, you can use the Redpanda CLI (`rpk`) to create a topic, produce messages to it, and consume messages from it. Each Redpanda broker comes preinstalled with `rpk`, so you can use it inside one of the Redpanda broker's Docker containers.

For simplicity, this quickstart uses the bootstrapped superuser (`superuser`) to perform all operations. The superuser has full administrative privileges, making it convenient for setup and exploration. However, to enhance security in a production environment, Redpanda Data recommends creating users with restricted permissions for each task.

To use `rpk` inside the Redpanda broker's Docker container:

. Get information about the cluster:
+
```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk cluster info -X user=superuser -X pass=secretpassword
```
// (step {"action":"runShell", "command": "rpk profile create quickstart --from-profile rpk-profile.yaml", "workingDirectory": "../docker-compose/three-brokers"})
// (step {"action":"runShell", "command": "rpk cluster info -X user=superuser -X pass=secretpassword", "workingDirectory": "../docker-compose/three-brokers"})


. Create a topic called **chat-room** with a replication factor of 3 to replicate the topic across all 3 brokers. This replication factor provides high availability and data durability. For more details, see xref:develop:config-topics.adoc#choose-the-replication-factor[Choose the replication factor].
+
```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic create chat-room --replicas 3 -X user=superuser -X pass=secretpassword
```
+
Output:
+
```bash
TOPIC       STATUS
chat-room  OK
```
// (step {"action":"runShell", "command": "rpk topic create chat-room --replicas 3 -X user=superuser -X pass=secretpassword"})

. Produce a message to the topic:
+
```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic produce chat-room -X user=superuser -X pass=secretpassword
```

. Enter a message, then press kbd:[Enter]:
+
```text
Pandas are fabulous!
```
+
Example output:
+
[.no-copy]
----
Produced to partition 0 at offset 0 with timestamp 1663282629789.
----
// (step {"action":"runShell", "command": "echo 'Pandas are fabulous!' | rpk topic produce chat-room -X user=superuser -X pass=secretpassword"})


. Press kbd:[Ctrl + C] to finish producing messages to the topic.

. Consume one message from the topic:
+
```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic consume chat-room --num 1 -X user=superuser -X pass=secretpassword
```
+
Your message is displayed along with its metadata:
+
```json
{
  "topic": "chat-room",
  "value": "Pandas are fabulous!",
  "timestamp": 1663282629789,
  "partition": 0,
  "offset": 0
}
```
// (step {"action":"runShell", "command": "rpk topic consume chat-room --num 1 -X user=superuser -X pass=secretpassword", "output": "/Pandas are fabulous!/", "timeout": 10000})

== Connect to the cluster externally

It's often more practical to connect to a remote cluster from your local machine with `rpk`. The `docker-compose.yml` file configured the containers to expose ports on your localhost, so you can communicate with the cluster outside the Docker network. To do so, download `rpk` on your local machine and configure it to connect to your cluster on the exposed ports.

. Install rpk on your local machine:
+
NOTE: The `rpk` binary is not supported on Windows.
+

--
macOS::

[loweralpha]
include::get-started:partial$install-rpk-homebrew.adoc[]
--
======

. Create a profile to configure `rpk` to connect to your cluster:
+
[,bash]
----
rpk profile create quickstart --from-profile rpk-profile.yaml
----
+
NOTE: The profile is configured in the `docker-compose/three-brokers/rpk-profile.yaml` file that you downloaded. This file is commented to explain how it works.

. Get information about the cluster to test the connection:
+
```bash
rpk cluster info
```
+
NOTE: The Redpanda broker returns a list of all broker addresses, so `rpk` can communicate with all brokers directly. Each broker returns its configured `advertise-*` address that matches the port to which the initial connection has been made. You can see examples of these addresses in the Docker Compose file that you downloaded.

== View offloaded data in Tiered Storage

Tiered Storage keeps local disk usage stable and performance consistent by offloading older data to object storage. You can also use Tiered Storage to recover clusters or topics, mount and unmount topics from a cluster, and more.

NOTE: For this quickstart, Redpanda uses MinIO as the object storage provider. MinIO is not supported for production deployments. For production, see xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/manual/production/requirements.adoc#object-storage-providers-for-tiered-storage[Object storage providers for Tiered Storage].

. Check the size of remote and local disks:
+
[,bash]
----
rpk cluster logdirs describe --topics logins
----
+
[.no-copy]
----
BROKER  DIR                     TOPIC   PARTITION  SIZE     ERROR
1       /var/lib/redpanda/data  logins  0          3364032
1       remote://redpanda       logins  0          3358193
----
+
- Local storage: `/var/lib/redpanda/data` holds recent data.
- Remote storage: `remote://redpanda` holds offloaded data.

. Open MinIO at http://localhost:9001/browser^ to view your data stored in the S3-compatible object store.

== Deploy a data streaming pipeline

Deploying a data streaming pipeline in Redpanda involves configuring and running connectors that ingest, transform, and route data between various sources and sinks. Redpanda Connect simplifies this process by allowing you to manage these pipelines using declarative YAML configuration files and the `rpk` CLI.

. Deploy the pipeline:
+
[,bash]
----
rpk connect run ../generate-profiles.yaml
----
+
NOTE: The pipeline configuration is in the `docker-compose/generate-profiles.yaml` file that you downloaded. This file is commented to explain how it works.

. Consume 10 messages from the `profiles` topic to confirm that the pipeline is producing data to it.
+
[,bash]
----
rpk topic consume profiles --num 10
----

== Extend your 30-day trial

Your initial trial license is valid for 30 days. To extend it by another 30 days:

NOTE: You can extend the trial license only once.

. https://cloud.redpanda.com/try-enterprise[Sign up for a new trial license^].

. Upload the new license to your running cluster using xref:reference:rpk/rpk-cluster/rpk-cluster-license-set.adoc[`rpk cluster license set`]:
+
[,bash]
----
rpk cluster license set <license>
----

This command applies the new license, extending your access to enterprise features for another 30 days.

== Customize the quickstart

To configure Redpanda, Redpanda Console, or Redpanda Connect, you need to customize the provided Docker Compose file. This allows you to tailor the services to fit your specific requirements.

=== Configure Redpanda in Docker

To configure the Redpanda services with xref:reference:node-properties.adoc[broker configuration properties], pass properties with the `--set` option in the `redpanda start` command in your Docker Compose file.

**Example:**

[source,yaml]
----
redpanda-0: <1>
  command: <2>
    - redpanda
    - start
    - --set pandaproxy_client.retries=6 <3>
----

<1> The service name in Docker Compose.
<2> Overrides the default command for the Redpanda container.
<3> Sets the `pandaproxy_client.retries` broker configuration property to `6`.

==== Configure cluster properties

Cluster-level configurations are defined in the `bootstrap.yml` file. This file is included in your Docker Compose setup. It contains essential settings that apply to the entire Redpanda cluster.

**Example:**

[source,yaml]
----
redpanda:
  volumes:
    - ../bootstrap.yml:/etc/redpanda/.bootstrap.yaml <1>
----

<1> Mounts the `bootstrap.yml` file from your local parent directory to the container's `/etc/redpanda/` directory.

=== Configure Redpanda Console in Docker

Redpanda Console configuration is managed with the environment variable `CONSOLE_CONFIG_FILE`. You can specify the path to your configuration file in the Docker Compose file.

**Example:**

[source,yaml]
----
console:
  environment:
    CONSOLE_CONFIG_FILE: |
      # Configure a connection to the Redpanda cluster
      # See https://docs.redpanda.com/current/console/config/connect-to-redpanda/
      kafka:
        brokers: ["redpanda-0:9092"]
        schemaRegistry:
          enabled: true
          urls: ["http://redpanda-0:8081","http://redpanda-1:8081","http://redpanda-2:8081"]
        sasl:
          enabled: true
          username: superuser
          password: secretpassword
          mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-256
----

=== Configure Redpanda Connect in Docker

Existing data pipelines are configured using the `CONNECT_CFG_FILE` environment variable in the `connect` service. This environment variable contains YAML configuration settings for Redpanda Connect.

**Example:**

[source,yaml]
----
connect:
  environment:
    CONNECT_CFG_FILE: |
      input:
        generate:
          interval: 1s
          mapping: |
            let first_name = fake("first_name")
            let last_name  = fake("last_name")

            root.user_id    = counter()
            root.name       = $$first_name + " " + $$last_name
            root.email      = ($$first_name.slice(0,1) + $$last_name + "@" + fake("domain_name")).lowercase()
            root.ip         = fake("ipv4")
            root.login_time = now()
      pipeline:
        processors:
          - mapping: |
              root = range(0, random_int(min:2, max:4)).map_each(cust -> this)
          - unarchive:
              format: "json_array"
          - mapping: |
              if batch_index() == 0 {
                meta topic = "logins"

== Clean up

If you don't want to continue experimenting with your cluster, you can shut it down and delete the containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To delete the volumes along with all your cluster data:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

// (step {"action":"runShell", "command": "rpk profile delete quickstart"})
// (step {"action":"runShell", "command": "docker compose down -v", "workingDirectory": "../docker-compose/three-brokers"})
// (test end)
