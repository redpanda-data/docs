[NOTE]
====
Redpanda in Docker is supported only for development and testing.
To deploy self-hosted Redpanda in production, use one of the following environments:

- xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/manual/index.adoc[Linux]
- xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/kubernetes/index.adoc[Kubernetes]

====

== Prerequisites

You need Docker Compose. For installation instructions, see the https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker Compose documentation^].

To check if you have Docker Compose installed, run:

```bash
docker compose version
```

You should see the version of Docker Compose that's installed on your local machine.

== Deploy Redpanda

For lightweight testing, you can start a single Redpanda broker,
or you can use a more robust example with three Redpanda brokers.
With three brokers, you can configure your topics with a replication factor of three
so that the cluster can recover from a single-broker failure.

== Start streaming

To start building a basic streaming application, you can use the `rpk` command-line tool to create a topic, produce messages to it, and consume messages from it.

Each Redpanda broker comes preinstalled with `rpk`, so you can use it inside one of the Redpanda broker's Docker containers, or you can install it on your local machine to test external connectivity.
The `docker-compose.yml` file configured the containers to expose ports on your localhost, so you can communicate with the cluster outside the Docker network.

To use `rpk` inside the Redpanda broker's Docker container:

. Get information about the cluster:
+
```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk cluster info
```

. Create a topic called **chat-room**:
+
```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic create chat-room
```
+
Output:
+
```bash
TOPIC       STATUS
chat-room  OK
```

. Produce a message to the topic:
+
```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic produce chat-room
```

. Enter a message, then press kbd:[Enter]:
+
```text
Pandas are fabulous!
```
+
Example output:
+
[.no-copy]
----
Produced to partition 0 at offset 0 with timestamp 1663282629789.
----

. Press kbd:[Ctrl + C] to finish producing messages to the topic.

. Consume one message from the topic:
+
```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic consume chat-room --num 1
```
+
Your message is displayed along with its metadata:
+
```json
{
  "topic": "chat-room",
  "value": "Pandas are fabulous!",
  "timestamp": 1663282629789,
  "partition": 0,
  "offset": 0
}
```

To test external connectivity using your local machine:

. Install rpk on your local machine:
+
NOTE: The `rpk` binary is not supported on Windows.

include::partial$install-rpk-linux.adoc[]

======

. Get information about the cluster to test the connection:
+
```bash
rpk cluster info -X brokers=127.0.0.1:19092
```
+
NOTE: The Redpanda broker returns a list of all broker addresses, so `rpk` can communicate with all brokers directly. Each broker returns its configured `advertise-*` address that matches the port to which the initial connection has been made.

== Explore your topic

To explore your topic, you can use Redpanda Console, which you deployed in the `docker-compose.yml` file and is running locally on port 8080.
Redpanda Console is a developer-friendly web UI for managing and debugging your Redpanda cluster and your applications.

. http://127.0.0.1:8080/overview[Open Redpanda Console^] in a web browser.
+
An overview of the cluster status, cluster health, and broker details is displayed.

. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/topics/chat-room[**Topics** > **chat-room**].
+
The message that you produced to the topic is displayed along with some other details about the topic.

== Customize the quickstart

If you want to configure Redpanda or Redpanda Console, you need to customize the example Docker Compose file.

=== Configure Redpanda in Docker

To configure the Redpanda services with xref:reference:node-properties.adoc[node configuration properties], you can do the following:

- Pass configuration properties to the `--set` option in the `redpanda start` command. For example:
+
[,yaml]
----
redpanda:
  command:
    - redpanda
    - start
    - --set pandaproxy_client.retries=6
----

- Create a `redpanda.yaml` file and mount it to the `/etc/redpanda/` directory on the `redpanda` containers. For example, if you create the `redpanda.yaml` file in a directory called `redpanda-mounts`, configure the following volume mounts:
+
[,yaml]
----
redpanda:
  volumes:
    - ./redpanda-mounts:/etc/redpanda/
----

=== Configure Redpanda Console in Docker

To configure the Redpanda Console service with xref:reference:console/config.adoc[configuration properties], you can do the following:

* Use environment variables, for example:
+
[,yaml]
----
console:
  environment:
    KAFKA_RACKID: rack1
----

* Create a `redpanda-console-config.yaml` file and mount it to the `/etc/redpanda/` directory on the `redpanda-console` container. For example, if you create the `redpanda-console-config.yaml` file in a directory called `console-mounts`, configure the following volume mounts:
+
[,yaml]
----
console:
  volumes:
    - ./console-mounts:/etc/redpanda/
----

== Clean up

If you don't want to continue experimenting with your cluster, you can shut it down and delete the containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To delete the volumes along with all your cluster data:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```
