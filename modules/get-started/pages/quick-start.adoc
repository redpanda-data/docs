[NOTE]
====
Redpanda in Docker is supported only for development and testing.
To deploy self-hosted Redpanda in production, use one of the following environments:

- xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/manual/index.adoc[Linux]
- xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/kubernetes/index.adoc[Kubernetes]

====

== Prerequisites

You need Docker Compose. For installation instructions, see the https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker Compose documentation^].

To check if you have Docker Compose installed, run the following:

```bash
docker compose version
```

You should see the version of Docker Compose that's installed on your local machine.

== Deploy Redpanda

For lightweight testing, you can start a single Redpanda broker,
or you can use a more robust example with three Redpanda brokers.
With three brokers, you can configure your topics with a replication factor of three
so that the cluster can recover from a single-broker failure.

== Start streaming

To start building a basic streaming application, you can use rpk to create a topic, produce messages to it, and consume messages from it.
rpk is a command-line tool for connecting to and interacting with Redpanda brokers.

Each Redpanda broker comes preinstalled with rpk, so you can use it inside one of the Redpanda broker's Docker containers or you can use install it on your local machine to test external connectivity.
The `docker-compose.yml` file configured the containers to expose ports on your localhost so that you can communicate with the cluster outside the Docker network.

To use rpk inside the Redpanda broker's Docker container:

. Get information about the cluster.
+
```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk cluster info
```

. Create a topic called `chat-room`:
+
```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic create chat-room
```
+
Output:
+
```bash
TOPIC       STATUS
chat-room  OK
```

. Produce a message to the topic:
+
```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic produce chat-room
```

. Enter a message, then press kbd:[Enter]:
+
```text
Pandas are fabulous!
```
+
Example output:
+
[.no-copy]
----
Produced to partition 0 at offset 0 with timestamp 1663282629789.
----

. Press kbd:[Ctrl + C] to finish producing messages to the topic.

. Consume one message from the topic:
+
```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic consume chat-room --num 1
```
+
Your message is displayed along with its metadata,:
+
```json
{
  "topic": "chat-room",
  "value": "Pandas are fabulous!",
  "timestamp": 1663282629789,
  "partition": 0,
  "offset": 0
}
```

To test external connectivity using your local machine:

. Install rpk on your local machine:
+
NOTE: The `rpk` binary is not supported on Windows.

include::partial$install-rpk-linux.adoc[]
--
macOS::

[loweralpha]
include::get-started:partial$install-rpk-homebrew.adoc[]

======

. Get information about the cluster to test the connection.
+
```bash
rpk cluster info -X brokers=127.0.0.1:19092
```
+
NOTE: The Redpanda broker returns a list of all broker addresses so that rpk can communicate with all brokers directly. Each broker returns its configured `advertise-*` address that matches the port to which the initial connection has been made.

== Explore your topic

To explore your topic, you can use Redpanda Console, which you deployed in the `docker-compose.yml` file and is running locally on port 8080.
Redpanda Console is a developer-friendly web UI for managing and debugging your Redpanda cluster and your applications.

. http://127.0.0.1:8080/overview[Open Redpanda Console^] in a web browser.
+
An overview of the cluster status, cluster health, and broker details is displayed.

. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/topics/chat-room[**Topics** > **chat-room**].
+
The message that you produced to the topic is displayed along with some other details about the topic.

== Clean up

If you don't want to continue experimenting with your cluster, you can shut it down and delete the containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To delete the volumes along with all your cluster data, run the following:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```
