== Write caching

xref:develop:config-topics.adoc#configure-write-caching[Write caching] is a relaxed mode of `acks=all` that provides better performance at the expense of durability. It acknowledges a message as soon as it is received and acknowledged on a majority of brokers, without waiting for it to fsync to disk. This provides lower latency while still ensuring that a majority of brokers acknowledge the write. For clusters in development mode, write caching is enabled by default. For clusters in production mode, it is disabled by default.

== RBAC
xref:manage:security/authorization/rbac.adoc[Role-based access control] (RBAC) provides an extension to Redpanda's existing access control lists (ACLs). It allows you to create roles and assign those roles as the authorized or denied party for an ACL. Every user you assign to that role inherits those authorizations. Using RBAC gives you a more flexible and more efficient tool to manage authorization for your users, especially when you have complex organizational hierarchies, large numbers of users, or both.  

== Data transforms

* Output to multiple topics: Data transforms can now output to multiple topics, for use cases that might require distributing different message types to multiple event streams, or for writing valid records to an output topic and invalid records to a dead-letter queue. See the xref:reference:data-transform-golang-sdk.adoc[Go] or xref:reference:data-transform-rust-sdk.adoc[Rust] SDK reference for data transforms for implementation details.

* xref:develop:data-transforms/run-transforms.adoc#view-data-transform-logs[Data transform logs] are now stored in an internally-managed topic and are accessible via `rpk` and the Redpanda Console.

== Topic-aware partition balancing 

Redpanda now xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/cluster-balancing.adoc[balances a topic's partition count on each broker] before balancing the cluster's overall partition count. Because different topics in a cluster can have vastly different load profiles, this better distributes the workload evenly across brokers. This feature is enabled by default with the `partition_autobalancing_topic_aware` property. After upgrading to 24.1, new topics are created in a topic-aware fashion, and the next partition rebalance (triggered by adding new brokers or by calling the `/v1/partitions/rebalance` Admin API endpoint) evens out the partition counts on each broker.

== New commands

The following `rpk` commands are new in this release:

- xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security.adoc[`rpk security`]
- xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security-role.adoc[`rpk security role`]
- xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security-role-assign.adoc[`rpk security role assign`]
- xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security-role-create.adoc[`rpk security role create`]
- xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security-role-delete.adoc[`rpk security role delete`]
- xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security-role-describe.adoc[`rpk security role describe`]
- xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security-role-list.adoc[`rpk security role list`]
- xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security-role-unassign.adoc[`rpk security role unassign`]

Additionally, to bundle security commands together, the existing `rpk acl` commands have moved into this new section as xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security-acl.adoc[`rpk security acl`]. The existing `rpk acl` commands still work as an alias.
