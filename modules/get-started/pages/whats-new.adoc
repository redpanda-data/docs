== Redpanda Console v3.0.0 (beta)

The Redpanda Console v3.0.0 beta release includes the following updates:

=== New features

Unified authentication and authorization system. Redpanda Console now supports user impersonation so you can authenticate to Redpanda using the same credentials you use to authenticate to Redpanda Console. This feature simplifies user management and allows you to use the same credentials for both Redpanda and Redpanda Console.

See xref:console:config/security/authentication.adoc[] for more information.

=== Breaking changes

include::upgrade:partial$console/v3-breaking-changes.adoc[]

See xref:upgrade:migrate/console-v3.adoc[].

== Iceberg improvements

xref:manage:iceberg/topic-iceberg-integration.adoc[Iceberg-enabled topics] now support custom partitioning for improved query performance, snapshot expiry, and a dead-letter queue for invalid records. Schema evolution is also supported with schema mutations implemented according to the Iceberg specification.

== Protobuf normalization in Schema Registry

Redpanda now supports normalization of Protobuf schemas in the Schema Registry. You can normalize Avro, JSON, and Protobuf schemas both during registration and lookup. For more information, see the xref:manage:schema-reg/schema-reg-overview.adoc#schema-normalization[Schema Registry overview], and the xref:api:ROOT:pandaproxy-schema-registry.adoc[Schema Registry API reference].

== SASL/PLAIN authentication

You now can configure Kafka clients to authenticate using xref:manage:security/authentication#enable-sasl.adoc[SASL/PLAIN] with a single account using the same username and password. Unlike SASL/SCRAM, which uses a challenge response with hashed credentials, SASL/PLAIN transmits plaintext passwords. You enable SASL/PLAIN by appending `PLAIN` to the list of SASL mechanisms.

== New cluster properties

The following cluster properties are new in this version:

=== Consumer metrics

- xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#enable_consumer_group_metrics[`enable_consumer_group_metrics`]: Enables detailed consumer group metrics collection.

=== Iceberg integration

- xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#iceberg_backlog_controller_p_coeff[`iceberg_backlog_controller_p_coeff`]: Configures the coefficient for backlog control in Iceberg tables.
- xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#iceberg_default_partition_spec[`iceberg_default_partition_spec`]: Sets the default partition specification for Iceberg tables.
- xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#iceberg_disable_snapshot_tagging[`iceberg_disable_snapshot_tagging`]: Disables snapshot tagging in Iceberg.
- xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#iceberg_invalid_record_action[`iceberg_invalid_record_action`]: Specifies the action for handling invalid records in Iceberg.
- xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#iceberg_rest_catalog_authentication_mode[`iceberg_rest_catalog_authentication_mode`]: Defines the authentication mode for the Iceberg REST catalog.
- xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#iceberg_rest_catalog_oauth2_server_uri[`iceberg_rest_catalog_oauth2_server_uri`]: Specifies the OAuth2 server URI for the Iceberg REST catalog.
- xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#iceberg_target_backlog_size[`iceberg_target_backlog_size`]: Sets the target backlog size for Iceberg.
- xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#iceberg_target_lag_ms[`iceberg_target_lag_ms`]: Configures the target lag (in milliseconds) for Iceberg.

=== Log compaction

- xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#log_compaction_adjacent_merge_self_compaction_count[`log_compaction_adjacent_merge_self_compaction_count`]: Adjusts the number of self-compaction merges during log compaction.

=== Raft optimization

- xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#raft_max_buffered_follower_append_entries_bytes_per_shard[`raft_max_buffered_follower_append_entries_bytes_per_shard`]: Limits the maximum bytes buffered for follower append entries per shard.
- xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#raft_max_inflight_follower_append_entries_requests_per_shard[`raft_max_inflight_follower_append_entries_requests_per_shard`]: Replaces the deprecated `raft_max_concurrent_append_requests_per_follower` to limit in-flight follower append requests per shard.

=== TLS configuration

- xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#tls_enable_renegotiation[`tls_enable_renegotiation`]: Enables support for TLS renegotiation.

=== Throughput quota

- xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#target_fetch_quota_byte_rate[`target_fetch_quota_byte_rate`]: Configures the fetch quota in bytes per second.

=== Topic configuration

- xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#topic_partitions_memory_allocation_percent[`topic_partitions_memory_allocation_percent`]: Adjusts the percentage of memory allocated for topic partitions.

=== Scheduler improvements

- xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#use_kafka_handler_scheduler_group[`use_kafka_handler_scheduler_group`]: Enables the Kafka handler scheduler group.
- xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#use_produce_scheduler_group[`use_produce_scheduler_group`]: Enables the produce scheduler group.

== Changes to default configuration

- xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#storage_read_readahead_count[`storage_read_readahead_count`]: Reduced default from `10` to `1` to optimize read throughput and minimize unaccounted memory usage, lowering the risk of OOM errors on local storage paths.
- xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#topic_partitions_per_shard[`topic_partitions_per_shard`]: Increased default from `1000` to `5000` to support larger partition counts per shard.

== Client quota properties removed

The following client configuration properties were deprecated in version 24.2.1, and have been removed in this release:

* `kafka_client_group_byte_rate_quota`
* `kafka_client_group_fetch_byte_rate_quota`
* `target_quota_byte_rate`
* `target_fetch_quota_byte_rate`
* `kafka_admin_topic_api_rate`

Use xref:reference:rpk/rpk-cluster/rpk-cluster-quotas.adoc[`rpk cluster quotas`] to manage xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/manage-throughput.adoc#client-throughput-limits[client throughput limits] based on the Kafka API.
