== FIPS compliance

Redpanda now provides a FIPS 140-compliant binary to support running Redpanda in environments requiring FIPS-compliant software and to meet certain requirements for organizations undergoing certification through government compliance programs, such as FedRAMP. When using the FIPS binary, both Redpanda and `rpk` leverage FIPS-compliant OpenSSL libraries and ciphers for all encryption activity inside Redpanda, including encryption of data in transit. Install the `redpanda-fips` package to xref:manage:security/fips-compliance.adoc[run Redpanda in FIPS-compliance mode].

== Schema Registry support for JSON

Redpanda's xref:manage:schema-reg/schema-reg-overview.adoc[Schema Registry] now supports JSON serialization format, in addition to Avro and Protobuf. You can use a https://json-schema.org/[JSON Schema^] format to validate messages and ensure compatibility between schema versions.

== Data transforms enhancements

You can now deploy data transform functions that xref:develop:data-transforms/deploy.adoc#reprocess[reprocess existing records] from an input topic. Processing existing records can be useful, for example, to process historical data into a different format for a new consumer, to re-create lost data from an accidentally-deleted topic, or to resolve issues with a previous version of a transform that processed data incorrectly.

The docs now also include an xref:develop:data-transforms/index.adoc[expanded guide] designed to help you master the creation, deployment, and management of data transforms in Redpanda.
