== SASL/PLAIN authentication 

You now can configure Kafka clients to authenticate using xref:manage:security/authentication#sasl.adoc[SASL/PLAIN] with a single account using the same username and password. Unlike SASL/SCRAM, which uses a challenge response with hashed credentials, SASL/PLAIN transmits plaintext passwords. You enable SASL/PLAIN by appending `PLAIN` to the list of SASL mechanisms.
