== Redpanda chart v25.2.1

link:https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-operator/blob/release/v25.2.x/charts/redpanda/CHANGELOG.md[Changelog^].

=== New chart-wide podTemplate field

You can now use the chart-wide `podTemplate` field to control Pod attributes across all components. This field has lower precedence than `statefulset.podTemplate` and `post_install_job.podTemplate` but will be merged with them.

Additionally, `podTemplate` fields now support template expressions within string fields, allowing you to use Helm templating for dynamic values:

[,yaml]
----
podTemplate:
  annotations:
    "release-name": '{{ .Release.Name }}'
----

This compensates for functionality lost with the removal of fields like `extraVolumes`, while being more maintainable and less error prone.

=== Improved config-watcher sidecar

The config-watcher sidecar is now a dedicated Go binary that handles user management and simplifies cluster health checks. Health checks no longer fail when the sole issue is that other nodes in the cluster are unavailable.

=== rpk debug bundle now works by default

The chart now creates `Roles` and `RoleBindings` that satisfy the requirements for running `rpk debug bundle --namespace` from any Redpanda Pod. These permissions may be disabled by setting `rbac.rpkDebugBundle=false`.

The Redpanda container now always has a Kubernetes ServiceAccount token mounted to ensure `rpk debug bundle` can be executed successfully.

=== ServiceAccount creation now enabled by default

The `serviceAccount.create` field now defaults to `true`. Previously, the chart used the `default` ServiceAccount and extended it with all bindings.

=== Stricter schema validation

Any unexpected values now result in a validation error. Previously, unexpected values would have been silently ignored.

Ensure your Helm values only include valid fields before upgrading.

=== Redpanda Console v3.1.0

The Console dependency has been updated to v3.1.0. The Console integration (`console.enabled=true`) now uses the chart-managed bootstrap user rather than the first user from `auth.sasl.users`.

=== Deprecated Helm values

The following Helm values are deprecated and will be removed in a future release:

* `statefulset.sidecars.controllers.image`: Use `statefulset.sidecars.image` instead
* `statefulset.sideCars.controllers.createRBAC`: Use `rbac.enabled` or per-controller settings instead
* `statefulset.sideCars.controllers.run`: Use individual controller enabled fields instead

=== Removed Helm values

Several fields have been removed in favor of using `podTemplate`. Before upgrading, review your configurations and migrate removed fields to their `podTemplate` equivalents. For the complete list of removed fields and their replacements, see the link:https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-operator/blob/release/v25.2.x/charts/redpanda/CHANGELOG.md[changelog^].
