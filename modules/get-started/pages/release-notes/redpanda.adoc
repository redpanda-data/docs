:description: Summary of new features and updates in this Redpanda release.
:page-aliases: get-started:whats-new-233.adoc, get-started:whats-new-241.adoc, get-started:whats-new.adoc

This topic includes new content added in version {page-component-version}. For a complete list of all product updates, see the https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases/[Redpanda release notes^]. See also:

* xref:redpanda-cloud:get-started:whats-new-cloud.adoc[]
* xref:redpanda-cloud:get-started:cloud-overview.adoc#redpanda-cloud-vs-self-managed-feature-compatibility[Redpanda Cloud vs Self-Managed feature compatibility]

== Crash recording for improved support

Redpanda now records detailed information about broker crashes to help streamline troubleshooting and reduce time to resolution. Crash reports include information such as a stack trace, exception details, the Redpanda broker version, and the timestamp of when the crash occurred. The recorded crash reports are now automatically collected as part of xref:troubleshoot:debug-bundle/overview.adoc[debug bundles], providing Redpanda customer support with more context to diagnose and resolve issues faster.

== New health probes for broker restarts and upgrades

The Redpanda Admin API now includes new health probes to help you ensure safe broker restarts and upgrades. The xref:api:ROOT:admin-api.adoc#get-/v1/broker/pre_restart_probe[`pre_restart_probe`] endpoint identifies potential risks if a broker is restarted, and xref:api:ROOT:admin-api.adoc#get-/v1/broker/post_restart_probe[`post_restart_probe`] indicates how much of its workloads a broker has reclaimed after the restart.

* xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/rolling-restart.adoc[]
* xref:upgrade:rolling-upgrade.adoc[]

== HTTP Proxy authentication changes

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Breaking change**: Starting in Redpanda 25.2, ephemeral credentials for HTTP Proxy are removed. If your HTTP Proxy API listeners use `authentication_method: none`, you must configure explicit SASL credentials for HTTP Proxy to authenticate with the Kafka API.
====

HTTP Proxy previously used automatically generated ephemeral credentials to authenticate with the Kafka API when the HTTP Proxy listeners had `authentication_method: none`. These ephemeral credentials are now removed to improve security and simplify the authentication model.

Without explicit SASL credentials configured, HTTP Proxy attempts unauthenticated connections to the Kafka API.

Redpanda Data recommends configuring authentication for HTTP Proxy to ensure secure communication with the Kafka API.

**Action required**: Configure the following HTTP Proxy client properties in your `redpanda.yaml` configuration:

- xref:reference:properties/broker-properties.adoc#scram_username[`scram_username`]: Username for SASL/SCRAM authentication
- xref:reference:properties/broker-properties.adoc#scram_password[`scram_password`]: Password for SASL/SCRAM authentication  
- xref:reference:properties/broker-properties.adoc#sasl_mechanism[`sasl_mechanism`]: SASL mechanism (typically `SCRAM-SHA-256` or `SCRAM-SHA-512`)

For detailed configuration instructions, see xref:manage:security/authentication.adoc#schema-and-http-to-redpanda[Configure HTTP Proxy to connect to Redpanda with SASL].

**Note**: This change does not affect Schema Registry, which continues to use ephemeral credentials.

== Redpanda Console v3.0.0

The Redpanda Console v3.0.0 release includes the following updates:

=== New features

Redpanda Console now supports unified authentication and authorization between Console and Redpanda, including user impersonation. This means you can authenticate to Redpanda using the same credentials you use for Redpanda Console.

See xref:console:config/security/authentication.adoc[] for more information.

=== Breaking changes

* **Authentication and authorization:**
  - Renamed the `login` stanza to `authentication`.
  - Renamed `login.jwtSecret` to `authentication.jwtSigningKey`.
  - Removed the plain login provider.
  - OIDC group-based authorization is no longer supported.
  - Role bindings must now be configured in the `authorization.roleBindings` stanza (no longer stored in a separate file).

* **Schema Registry:**
  - Moved from under the `kafka` stanza to a top-level `schemaRegistry` stanza.
  - All authentication settings for Schema Registry are now defined under `schemaRegistry.authentication`.

* **Admin API:**
  - Authentication for the Redpanda Admin API is now defined under `redpanda.adminApi.authentication`.

* **Serialization settings:**
  - Moved `kafka.protobuf`, `kafka.cbor`, and `kafka.messagePack` to a new top-level `serde` stanza.
  - The `kafka.protobuf.schemaRegistry` setting is deprecated. Use the top-level `schemaRegistry` stanza instead.

* **Connect:**
  - Renamed the `connect` stanza to `kafkaConnect` to avoid ambiguity with Redpanda Connect.

* **Console settings:**
  - Moved `console.maxDeserializationPayloadSize` to `serde.maxDeserializationPayloadSize`.

*Action required*: xref:migrate:console-v3.adoc[].

=== Other changes

The admin panel has been removed from the Redpanda Console UI. To manage users, use the Security page. To generate debug bundles, use the link on the Cluster overview page. To upload a new license, use the link on the Cluster overview page or in the license expiration warning banner.

== Iceberg improvements

Iceberg-enabled topics now support the following:

- xref:manage:iceberg/about-iceberg-topics.adoc#use-custom-partitioning[Custom partitioning] for improved query performance.
- xref:manage:iceberg/query-iceberg-topics.adoc#access-iceberg-tables[Snapshot expiry].
- xref:manage:iceberg/about-iceberg-topics.adoc#manage-dead-letter-queue[Dead-letter queue] for invalid records.
- xref:manage:iceberg/about-iceberg-topics.adoc#schema-evolution[Schema evolution], with schema mutations implemented according to the Iceberg specification.
- For Avro and Protobuf data, structured Iceberg tables without the use of the Schema Registry wire format or SerDes. See xref:manage:iceberg/choose-iceberg-mode.adoc[] for more information.

== Protobuf normalization in Schema Registry

Redpanda now supports normalization of Protobuf schemas in the Schema Registry. You can normalize Avro, JSON, and Protobuf schemas both during registration and lookup. For more information, see the xref:manage:schema-reg/schema-reg-overview.adoc#schema-normalization[Schema Registry overview], and the xref:api:ROOT:pandaproxy-schema-registry.adoc[Schema Registry API reference].

== Protobuf well-known types in `rpk`

Support for https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf/[Protobuf well-known types^] is available in `rpk` when encoding and decoding records using Schema Registry.

== SASL/PLAIN authentication

You now can configure Kafka clients to authenticate using xref:manage:security/authentication#enable-sasl.adoc[SASL/PLAIN] with a single account using the same username and password. Unlike SASL/SCRAM, which uses a challenge response with hashed credentials, SASL/PLAIN transmits plaintext passwords. You enable SASL/PLAIN by appending `PLAIN` to the list of SASL mechanisms.

== Pause and resume uploads

Redpanda now supports xref:manage:tiered-storage.adoc#pause-and-resume-uploads[pausing and resuming uploads] to object storage when running Tiered Storage, with no risk to data consistency or data loss. You can use the xref:reference:properties/object-storage-properties.adoc#cloud_storage_enable_segment_uploads[`cloud_storage_enable_segment_uploads`] property to pause or resume uploads to help you troubleshoot any issues that  occur in your cluster during uploads. 

== Trial license 

All new Redpanda clusters automatically receive a xref:get-started:licensing/overview.adoc#trial-license[trial license] valid for 30 days. You can extend this trial for 30 days using the new xref:reference:rpk/rpk-generate/rpk-generate-license.adoc[`rpk generate license`] command.

== Metrics

The following metrics are new in this version:

=== Consumer lag gauges

Redpanda can now expose dedicated consumer lag gauges that eliminate the need to calculate lag manually. These metrics provide real-time insights into consumer group performance and help identify issues. The following metrics are available:

- xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc#redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_lag_max[`redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_lag_max`]:
