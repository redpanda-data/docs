== Shadowing

Redpanda v25.3 introduces xref:deploy:redpanda/manual/disaster-recovery/shadowing/index.adoc[], an Enterprise-licensed disaster recovery solution that provides asynchronous, offset-preserving replication between distinct Redpanda clusters. Shadowing enables cross-region data protection by replicating topic data, configurations, consumer group offsets, ACLs, and Schema Registry data with byte-level fidelity.

The shadow cluster operates in read-only mode while continuously receiving updates from the source cluster. During a disaster, you can failover individual topics or an entire shadow link to make resources fully writable for production traffic. See xref:deploy:redpanda/manual/disaster-recovery/shadowing/disaster-response.adoc[] for emergency procedures.

== Connected client monitoring

You can view details about Kafka client connections using the Admin API ListKafkaConnections endpoint. This allows you to view detailed information about about active client connections on a cluster, and identify and troubleshoot problematic clients. For more information, see xref:manage:monitoring.adoc#identify-high-throughput-clients[Monitor Redpanda].

== New Admin API endpoints 

Redpanda v25.3 introduces a new API style for the Admin API, powered by https://connectrpc.com/docs/introduction[ConnectRPC]. New Redpanda features and operations in v25.3 are available as ConnectRPC services, allowing you to use autogenerated Protobuf clients in addition to using HTTP clients such as `curl`. 

Use the new ConnectRPC endpoints with the following v25.3 features:

* Shadowing
* Connected client monitoring

Existing Admin API endpoints from versions earlier than 25.3 remain supported, and you can continue to use them as usual. See xref:manage:use-admin-api.adoc[Manage Redpanda with the Admin API] to learn more about Admin API, and the link:/api/doc/admin/v2/[Admin API reference] to view the new endpoints.

== Schema Registry import mode

Redpanda Schema Registry now supports an import mode that allows you to import existing schemas and retain their current IDs and version numbers. Import mode is useful when migrating from another schema registry. 

Starting with this release, import mode must be used when importing schemas. Read-write mode no longer allows specifying a schema ID and version when registering a schema.
See xref:manage:schema-reg/schema-reg-api.adoc#set-schema-registry-mode[Use the Schema Registry API] for more information.
