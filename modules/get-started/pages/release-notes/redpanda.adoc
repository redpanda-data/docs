== New health probes for broker restarts and upgrades

The Redpanda Admin API now includes new health probes to help you ensure safe broker restarts and upgrades. The xref:api:ROOT:admin-api.adoc#get-/v1/broker/pre_restart_probe[`pre_restart_probe`] endpoint identifies potential risks if a broker is restarted, and xref:api:ROOT:admin-api.adoc#get-/v1/broker/post_restart_probe[`post_restart_probe`] indicates how much of its workloads a broker has reclaimed after the restart. See also: 

* xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/rolling-restart.adoc[]
* xref:upgrade:rolling-upgrade.adoc[]

== Redpanda Console v3.0.0 (beta)

The Redpanda Console v3.0.0 beta release includes the following updates:

=== New features

Redpanda Console now supports unified authentication and authorization between Console and Redpanda, including user impersonation. This means you can authenticate to Redpanda using the same credentials you use for Redpanda Console.

See xref:console:config/security/authentication.adoc[] for more information.

=== Breaking changes

* **Authentication and authorization:**
  - Renamed the `login` stanza to `authentication`.
  - Renamed `login.jwtSecret` to `authentication.jwtSigningSecret`.
  - Removed the plain login provider.
  - OIDC group-based authorization is no longer supported.
  - Role bindings must now be configured in the `authorization.roleBindings` stanza (no longer stored in a separate file).

* **Schema Registry:**
  - Moved from under the `kafka` stanza to a top-level `schemaRegistry` stanza.
  - All authentication settings for Schema Registry are now defined under `schemaRegistry.authentication`.

* **Admin API:**
  - Authentication for the Redpanda Admin API is now defined under `redpanda.adminApi.authentication`.

* **Serialization settings:**
  - Moved `kafka.protobuf`, `kafka.cbor`, and `kafka.messagePack` to a new top-level `serde` stanza.
  - The `kafka.protobuf.schemaRegistry` setting is deprecated. Use the top-level `schemaRegistry` stanza instead.

* **Connect:**
  - Renamed the `connect` stanza to `kafkaConnect` to avoid ambiguity with Redpanda Connect.

* **Console settings:**
  - Moved `console.maxDeserializationPayloadSize` to `serde.console.maxDeserializationPayloadSize`.

*Action required*: xref:upgrade:migrate/console-v3.adoc[].

=== Other changes

The admin panel has been removed from the Redpanda Console UI. To manage users, use the Security page. To generate debug bundles, use the link on the Cluster overview page. To upload a new license, use the link on the Cluster overview page or in the license expiration warning banner.

== Iceberg improvements

xref:manage:iceberg/topic-iceberg-integration.adoc[Iceberg-enabled topics] now support custom partitioning for improved query performance, snapshot expiry, and a dead-letter queue for invalid records. Schema evolution is also supported with schema mutations implemented according to the Iceberg specification.

== Protobuf normalization in Schema Registry

Redpanda now supports normalization of Protobuf schemas in the Schema Registry. You can normalize Avro, JSON, and Protobuf schemas both during registration and lookup. For more information, see the xref:manage:schema-reg/schema-reg-overview.adoc#schema-normalization[Schema Registry overview], and the xref:api:ROOT:pandaproxy-schema-registry.adoc[Schema Registry API reference].

== Protobuf well-known types in `rpk`

Support for https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf/[Protobuf well-known types^] is available in `rpk` when encoding and decoding records using Schema Registry.

== SASL/PLAIN authentication

You now can configure Kafka clients to authenticate using xref:manage:security/authentication#enable-sasl.adoc[SASL/PLAIN] with a single account using the same username and password. Unlike SASL/SCRAM, which uses a challenge response with hashed credentials, SASL/PLAIN transmits plaintext passwords. You enable SASL/PLAIN by appending `PLAIN` to the list of SASL mechanisms.

== Metrics

The following metrics are new in this version:

=== Consumer lag gauges

Redpanda can now expose dedicated consumer lag gauges that eliminate the need to calculate lag manually. These metrics provide real-time insights into consumer group performance and help identify issues. The following metrics are available:

- xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc#redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_lag_max[`redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_lag_max`]:
Reports the maximum lag observed among all partitions for a consumer group. This metric helps pinpoint the partition with the greatest delay, indicating potential performance or configuration issues.

- xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc#redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_lag_sum[`redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_lag_sum`]:
Aggregates the lag across all partitions, providing an overall view of data consumption delay for the consumer group.
