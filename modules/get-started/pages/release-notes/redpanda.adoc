This topic includes new content added in version {page-component-version}. For a complete list of all product updates, see the https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases/[Redpanda release notes^]. See also:

NOTE: Redpanda v25.3 introduces breaking schema changes for Iceberg topics. If you are using Iceberg topics and want to retain the data in the corresponding Iceberg tables, review xref:upgrade:iceberg-schema-changes-and-migration-guide.adoc[] before upgrading your cluster, and follow the required migration steps to avoid sending new records to a dead-letter queue table.

== Iceberg topics with GCP BigLake

A new xref:manage:iceberg/iceberg-topics-gcp-biglake.adoc[REST catalog integration] with Google Cloud BigLake allows you to add Redpanda topics as Iceberg tables in your data lakehouse.

See xref:manage:iceberg/use-iceberg-catalogs.adoc[] for details on configuring Iceberg REST catalog integrations with Redpanda.

== Shadowing

Redpanda v25.3 introduces xref:deploy:redpanda/manual/disaster-recovery/shadowing/index.adoc[], an enterprise-licensed disaster recovery solution that provides asynchronous, offset-preserving replication between distinct Redpanda clusters. Shadowing enables cross-region data protection by replicating topic data, configurations, consumer group offsets, ACLs, and Schema Registry data with byte-level fidelity.

The shadow cluster operates in read-only mode while continuously receiving updates from the source cluster. During a disaster, you can failover individual topics or an entire shadow link to make resources fully writable for production traffic. See xref:deploy:redpanda/manual/disaster-recovery/shadowing/failover-runbook.adoc[] for emergency procedures.

Shadowing includes comprehensive metrics for monitoring replication health. See xref:manage:disaster-recovery/shadowing/monitor.adoc[] and xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc#shadow-link-metrics[Shadow Link metrics reference].

== Connected client monitoring

You can view details about Kafka client connections using `rpk` or the Admin API ListKafkaConnections endpoint. This allows you to view detailed information about active client connections on a cluster, and identify and troubleshoot problematic clients. For more information, see the xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/manage-throughput.adoc#view-connected-client-details[connected client details] example in the Manage Throughput guide.

== New Admin API style 

Redpanda v25.3 introduces a new API style for the Admin API, powered by https://connectrpc.com/docs/introduction[ConnectRPC]. New Redpanda features and operations in v25.3 are available as ConnectRPC services, allowing you to use autogenerated Protobuf clients in addition to using HTTP clients such as `curl`. 

Use the new ConnectRPC endpoints with the following v25.3 features:

* Shadowing
* Connected client monitoring

Existing Admin API endpoints from versions earlier than 25.3 remain supported, and you can continue to use them as usual. See xref:manage:use-admin-api.adoc[Manage Redpanda with the Admin API] to learn more about Admin API, and the link:/api/doc/admin/v2/[Admin API reference] to view the new endpoints.

== Schema Registry import mode

Redpanda Schema Registry now supports an import mode that allows you to import existing schemas and retain their current IDs and version numbers. Import mode is useful when migrating from another schema registry.

Starting with this release, import mode must be used when importing schemas. Read-write mode no longer allows specifying a schema ID and version when registering a schema.
See xref:manage:schema-reg/schema-reg-api.adoc#set-schema-registry-mode[Use the Schema Registry API].

== Security report

You can now generate a security report for your Redpanda cluster using the link:/api/doc/admin/operation/operation-get_security_report[`/v1/security/report`] Admin API endpoint. The report provides detailed information about TLS configuration, authentication methods, authorization status, and security alerts across all Redpanda interfaces (Kafka, RPC, Admin, Schema Registry, HTTP Proxy).

== Topic identifiers

Redpanda v25.3 implements topic identifiers using 16 byte UUIDs as proposed in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-516%3A+Topic+Identifiers[KIP-516^].

== Shadowing metrics

Redpanda v25.3 introduces comprehensive xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc#shadow-link-metrics[Shadowing metrics] for monitoring disaster recovery replication:

* xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc#redpanda_shadow_link_client_errors[`redpanda_shadow_link_client_errors`] - Track Kafka client errors during shadow link operations
* xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc#redpanda_shadow_link_shadow_lag[`redpanda_shadow_link_shadow_lag`] - Monitor replication lag between source and shadow partitions

== New commands

Redpanda v25.3 introduces the following xref:reference:rpk/rpk-shadow/rpk-shadow.adoc[`rpk shadow`] commands for managing Redpanda shadow links:

* xref:reference:rpk/rpk-shadow/rpk-shadow-config-generate.adoc[`rpk shadow config generate`] - Generate configuration files for shadow links
