== Group-based access control (GBAC)

Redpanda {page-component-version} introduces xref:manage:security/authorization/gbac.adoc[group-based access control (GBAC)], which extends OIDC authentication to support group-based permissions. Instead of assigning roles or ACLs to individual users, you can assign them to OIDC groups. Users inherit permissions from all groups reported by their identity provider (IdP) in the OIDC token claims.

GBAC supports two authorization patterns:

* Assign a group as a member of an RBAC role so that all users in the group inherit the role's ACLs.
* Create ACLs directly with a `Group:<name>` principal.

Group membership is managed entirely by your IdP. Redpanda reads group information from the OIDC token at authentication time and works across all Redpanda APIs (Kafka, Admin, Schema Registry, and HTTP Proxy). An Enterprise license is required.

== New configuration properties
