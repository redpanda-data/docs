== Iceberg topics with AWS Glue

A new xref:manage:iceberg/iceberg-topics-aws-glue.adoc[integration with AWS Glue Data Catalog] allows you to add Redpanda topics as Iceberg tables in your data lakehouse. The AWS Glue catalog integration is available in Redpanda version 25.1.7 and later.

See xref:manage:iceberg/rest-catalog/index.adoc[] for supported Iceberg REST catalog integrations.

== JSON Schema support for Iceberg topics

Redpanda now supports JSON Schema for Iceberg topics. This allows you to use all supported schema types (Protobuf, Avro, and JSON Schema) for Iceberg topics. For more information, see xref:manage:iceberg/specify-iceberg-schema.adoc[].

== Manage SASL users with Kafka APIs

Redpanda now supports the following Kafka APIs for managing SASL user credentials as described in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-554%3A+Add+Broker-side+SCRAM+Config+API[KIP-554^]:

- DescribeUserSCRAMCredentialsRequest (requires Cluster Describe ACLs)
- AlterUserSCRAMCredentialsRequest (requires Cluster Modify ACLs)

See also: xref:manage:security/authentication.adoc#sasl[Configure Authentication] and xref:manage:security/authorization/acl.adoc[]

== Retrieve serialized Protobuf schemas with Schema Registry API

Starting in version 25.2, the Schema Registry API supports retrieving serialized schemas (Protobuf only) using the `format=serialized` query parameter for the following endpoints:

- `GET /schemas/ids/\{id}`
- `POST /subjects/\{subject}`
- `GET subjects/\{subject}/versions/\{version}`
- `GET subjects/\{subject}/versions/\{version}/schema`

This helps facilitate migration of Protobuf clients to Redpanda. See the xref:api:ROOT:schema-registry-api.adoc[Schema Registry API reference] for details.

== Support for confluent-kafka-javascript client

The `confluent-kafka-javascript` client is now validated with Redpanda. For a list of validated clients, see xref:develop:kafka-clients.adoc[].

== HTTP Proxy authentication changes

[IMPORTANT]
====
include::shared:partial$http-proxy-ephemeral-credentials-breaking-change.adoc[tags=!*;include-config-link]
====

HTTP Proxy previously used automatically-generated ephemeral credentials to authenticate with the Kafka API when the HTTP Proxy listeners specified `authentication_method: none`. To improve security and simplify the authentication model, ephemeral credentials are no longer available.

If you need to maintain the current HTTP Proxy functionality while transitioning to authenticated clients, configure the following HTTP Proxy client properties in your `redpanda.yaml` configuration:

- xref:reference:properties/broker-properties.adoc#scram_username[`scram_username`]: Username for SASL/SCRAM authentication
- xref:reference:properties/broker-properties.adoc#scram_password[`scram_password`]: Password for SASL/SCRAM authentication  
- xref:reference:properties/broker-properties.adoc#sasl_mechanism[`sasl_mechanism`]: SASL mechanism (typically `SCRAM-SHA-256` or `SCRAM-SHA-512`)

== Cluster properties

The following cluster properties are new in this version:

=== Iceberg integration

* config_ref:iceberg_rest_catalog_base_location,true,properties/cluster-properties[`iceberg_rest_catalog_base_location`]: Specifies the base location for the Iceberg REST catalog. Required for AWS Glue Data Catalog.
