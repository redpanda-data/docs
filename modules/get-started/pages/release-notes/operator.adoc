=== ShadowLink resource for disaster recovery

Redpanda Operator v25.3.x introduces the ShadowLink custom resource for managing shadow links in Kubernetes. The ShadowLink resource allows you to declaratively configure and manage disaster recovery replication between Redpanda clusters.

* **Declarative configuration**: Define shadow links as Kubernetes resources with full lifecycle management.
* **Status monitoring**: View shadow link health and replication status directly from Kubernetes.
* **Integrated failover**: Delete the ShadowLink resource to fail over all topics.

See xref:manage:kubernetes/shadowing/k-shadow-linking.adoc[Shadow Linking in Kubernetes] for setup and xref:manage:kubernetes/shadowing/k-monitor-shadowing.adoc[monitoring] documentation.
