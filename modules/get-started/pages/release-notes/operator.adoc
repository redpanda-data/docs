This version does not support Redpanda Console v2.

=== Flux removed

This release completely removes Flux and the `chartRef.useFlux` configuration. The Redpanda Operator now manages all resources.

=== Schema validation

The Redpanda custom resource definition (CRD) now includes built-in schema validation to ensure configurations conform to expected standards. With schema validation enabled, you must ensure your Redpanda CRD configurations include valid fields.

=== Updated versioning scheme

An updated versioning scheme now better supports and tracks compatible Redpanda versions, ensuring smoother upgrades and improved compatibility management.

See also: xref:upgrade:k-compatibility.adoc[].

=== Connectors subchart removed

The connectors subchart has been removed from the Helm chart because it is not officially supported.

:tip-caption: Try Redpanda Connect

TIP: For a supported and scalable Kafka Connect alternative, consider using Redpanda Connect. For more information, see xref:redpanda-connect:get-started:index.adoc[].

== Redpanda Operator v2.4.x

link:https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-operator/blob/release/v2.4.x/operator/CHANGELOG.md[Changelog].

=== Flux disabled by default

In version v2.3.x the `chartRef.useFlux` configuration was in beta and set to `true` by default. Starting from version v2.4.0, the `chartRef.useFlux:false` configuration is both GA and the default.

*Breaking change:* If you depend on Flux, explicitly set `chartRef.useFlux: true` in your configuration.

Example:

[,yaml]
----
spec:
  chartRef:
    useFlux: true
----

If you upgrade to v2.4.x from an older version in which Flux was already enabled, Flux will remain in use. If Flux was disabled previously, it will stay disabled after an upgrade unless you explicitly enable it.

=== Smarter Kubernetes rolling restarts and upgrades

This release improves how brokers are marked healthy, reducing unnecessary stalls during upgrades, especially under load.

=== Unified versioning for the Redpanda Operator Helm chart

Starting with Redpanda Operator v2.4.0, the Helm chart versioning has been streamlined so that the chart version is always identical to the Redpanda Operator's version. The `version` field now matches the `appVersion` field.

This unified versioning approach simplifies the upgrade process, ensuring that you always deploy the chart corresponding to your desired version of the Redpanda Operator.

== Redpanda Operator v2.3.x

link:https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-operator/blob/release/v2.3.x/operator/CHANGELOG.md[Changelog].

=== Declarative schema management

The Redpanda Operator now supports declarative schema management using the Schema custom resource, starting in version v2.3.0. This feature allows you to:

- Define, create, and manage Avro, Protobuf, and JSON schemas declaratively.
- Enforce schema compatibility and evolution policies directly in Kubernetes.
- Automate schema lifecycle management alongside Redpanda deployments.

To learn more, see the xref:manage:kubernetes/k-schema-controller.adoc[Schema custom resource documentation].

=== Use Redpanda Operator without Flux

The Redpanda Operator now supports the `chartRef.useFlux` flag, giving you control over resource management, starting in version v2.3.0.

- `chartRef.useFlux: false`: Directly manages resources within the Redpanda Operator, bypassing Flux.
- `chartRef.useFlux: true`: Delegates Redpanda resource management to Flux controllers through HelmRelease resources.

This flag is in beta and set to `true` by default. If you want to use the Redpanda Operator without Flux, set `chartRef.useFlux: false` in your configuration.

== Redpanda Operator v2.2.x

=== Declarative user and ACL management

The Redpanda Operator now supports declarative management of users and access control lists (ACLs) using the new User custom resource, starting in version v2.2.2. This feature allows you to:

- Create and manage Redpanda users and their authentication settings.
- Define and manage ACLs to control access to Redpanda resources.
- Automatically reconcile changes to users and ACLs using the Redpanda Operator.

To learn more, see the xref:manage:kubernetes/security/authentication/k-user-controller.adoc[User custom resource documentation].
