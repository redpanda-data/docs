== RBAC overview

RBAC is designed to address the critical challenge of access management at scale. Instead of managing individual ACLs for each user, RBAC lets you group permissions into roles and assign those roles to users. You define roles that reflect organizational structure or job duties, grant permissions to those roles, then assign roles to users. This approach decouples users and permissions, allowing a one-to-many mapping that dramatically reduces the number of custom policies needed.

Benefits of RBAC:

* Simplified management: Create roles once, assign to many users
* Easier onboarding: New employees inherit permissions by role assignment
* Faster audits: Review permissions by role rather than individual user
* Better compliance: Roles align with organizational structure and job duties
* Reduced errors: Fewer individual ACL assignments mean fewer mistakes

== Create roles

In {ui}, select `Security` from the left navigation menu, and then select either the `Roles` tab (for role principals) or the `ACLs` tab (for user principals).

For `rpk`, use xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security.adoc[`rpk security`]. For example, suppose you want to create a `DataAnalysts` role for users who need to read from analytics topics and write to reporting topics:

[,bash]
----
# 1. Create the role
rpk security role create DataAnalysts

# 2. Grant read access to analytics topics
rpk security acl create --operation read,describe \
  --topic 'analytics-*' --resource-pattern-type prefixed \
  --allow-role DataAnalysts

# 3. Grant write access to reporting topics  
rpk security acl create --operation write,describe \
  --topic 'reports-*' --resource-pattern-type prefixed \
  --allow-role DataAnalysts

# 4. Assign users to the role
rpk security role assign DataAnalysts --principal alice,bob,charlie

# 5. Verify the setup
rpk security role describe DataAnalysts
----

All three users (`alice`, `bob`, `charlie`) now have identical permissions without managing individual ACLs for each user.


== RBAC terminology

Understanding RBAC terminology is essential for effective role management:

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Term | Definition | Example

| Role
| A named collection of ACLs that can be assigned to users
| `DataEngineers`, `ApplicationDevelopers`, `ReadOnlyUsers`

| Principal
| A user account in the system (same as ACL principals)
| `User:alice`, `User:bob`, `User:analytics-service`

| Permission
| An ACL rule that allows or denies specific operations
| `ALLOW READ on topic:sensor-data`, `DENY DELETE on cluster`

| Assignment
| The association between a user and one or more roles
| User `alice` has roles `DataEngineers` and `TopicAdmins`
|===

RBAC workflow:

1. *Create roles*: Define roles that match your organizational needs
2. *Grant permissions*: Create ACLs specifying the role as allowed/denied
3. *Assign users*: Associate users with appropriate roles
4. *Automatic inheritance*: Users gain all permissions from their assigned roles

Under the RBAC framework, you create *roles*, grant *permissions* to those roles, and assign the roles to *users*. When you change the permissions for a given role, all users with that role automatically gain the modified permissions. You grant or deny permissions for a role by creating an ACL and specifying the RBAC role as either allowed or denied respectively.

Redpanda treats all *users* as security principals and defines them with the `Type:Name` syntax (for example, `User:mike`). You can omit the `Type` when defining a principal and Redpanda will assume the `User:` type. All examples here use the full syntax for clarity.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
See xref:manage:security/authorization/acl.adoc[access control lists] for more information on defining ACLs and working with principals.
endif::[]

ifdef::env-cloud[]
See xref:security:authorization/rbac/acl.adoc[access control lists] for more information on defining ACLs and working with principals.
endif::[]

=== Roles

You can assign any number of roles to a given user. When installing a new Redpanda cluster, no roles are provisioned by default. 

ifndef::env-cloud[]
To use RBAC, you must create your first roles using your `superuser` account, which enables you to create additional roles and assign appropriate ACLs as necessary. See xref:security/authentication.adoc#create_superusers[configure authentication] for more information on creating and managing superusers.

endif::[]

When performing an upgrade from older versions of Redpanda, all existing SASL/SCRAM users are assigned to the placeholder `Users` role to help you more readily migrate away from pure ACLs. As a security measure, this default role has no assigned ACLs. 

=== Policy conflicts

You can assign a combination of ACLs and roles to any given principal. ACLs allow permissions, deny permissions, or specify a combination of both. As a result, users may at times have role assignments with conflicting policies. 

Permission resolution rules:

A user is permitted to perform an operation if and only if:

. *No DENY permission exists* matching the operation
. *An ALLOW permission exists* matching the operation

Examples:

[cols="2,2,1,2"]
|===
| User's direct ACLs | Role-based ACLs | Result | Explanation

| `ALLOW READ topic:logs`
| Role has `DENY READ topic:logs`
| ❌ DENIED
| DENY always takes precedence

| `DENY WRITE topic:sensitive`
| Role has `ALLOW WRITE topic:*`
| ❌ DENIED
| Specific DENY blocks wildcard ALLOW

| No direct ACLs
| Role has `ALLOW READ topic:data`
| ✅ ALLOWED
| Role permission applies

| `ALLOW READ topic:public`
| No role ACLs for this topic
| ✅ ALLOWED
| Direct permission applies
|===

ifndef::env-cloud[]

=== RBAC example

Consider a scenario where your software engineers use a set of private topics to publish application update information to users. All your private topics begin with the prefix `private-`. You might create a new `SoftwareEng` role to represent the software engineers with write access to these private topics. You would then assign the `SoftwareEng` role as the allowed role for a new ACL specifying read and write permissions to `private-*`. Using a wildcard includes all existing private topics and any new ones you might create later. You then assign the new role to John and Jane, your two software engineers who will write messages to this topic. The `rpk` commands to accomplish this are:

[,bash]
----
rpk security role create SoftwareEng &&
rpk security acl create --operation read --operation write --topic private-* --allow-role SoftwareEng &&
rpk security role assign SoftwareEng --principal User:john,User:jane
----

This diagram shows the relationships between users, roles, and ACLs:

image::shared:rbac-roles.png[RBAC role assignments]

Consider the situation where you want to create a new topic, `private-software-versions`, where users self-report the version of a component they are using. If you were using the ACL authorization mechanism, you would need to assign this ACL to every user in your Redpanda installation. Using RBAC allows you to make one update and apply it to everyone with that role. Adding the write permissions for this topic to the `User` role means everyone with that role (all authenticated users in the diagram) gains the authorization immediately. For example:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create --operation write --topic private-software-versions --allow-role User
----

endif::[]

== RBAC best practices

Follow these recommendations for effective role-based access control:

Role design

* Use descriptive names: Choose role names that clearly indicate their purpose (`DataEngineers`, `ReadOnlyAnalysts`)
* Follow job functions: Align roles with actual job responsibilities and organizational structure
* Keep roles focused: Create specific roles rather than overly broad ones (`TopicReaders` vs `SuperUsers`)
* Plan for growth: Design roles that can accommodate new team members and evolving needs

Permission management

* Start with minimal permissions: Grant only the access required for the role's function
* Use wildcards carefully: Prefixed patterns like `analytics-*` are useful but review regularly
* Avoid DENY rules: Prefer specific ALLOW rules over complex DENY/ALLOW combinations
* Document role purpose: Maintain clear documentation about what each role is intended for

Operational guidelines

* Regular reviews: Audit roles and assignments quarterly to ensure they remain appropriate
* Least privilege: Users should have the minimum roles needed for their current responsibilities
* Temporary access: Create time-limited roles for contractors or temporary project access
* Monitor usage: Track which roles and permissions are actively used vs. dormant

Common management tasks:

* Create roles: Define new roles for organizational functions
* Assign permissions: Add ACLs to roles to define what they can access
* Assign users: Associate users with appropriate roles
* Modify roles: Add or remove permissions from existing roles
* Audit access: Review roles and assignments for compliance

Typical workflow:

. Create role 
. Add ACL permissions
. Assign users
. Test access
. Monitor and adjust

=== Create a role

Creating a new role is a two-step process. First you define the role, giving it a unique and descriptive name. Second, you assign one or more ACLs to allow or deny access for the new role. This defines the permissions that are inherited by all users assigned to the role. It is possible to have an empty role with no ACLs assigned.

[tabs]
=====
rpk::
+
--
To create a new role, run:

[,bash]
----
rpk security role create <role_name>
----

After the role is created, administrators create new ACLs and assign this role either allow or deny permissions. For example:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create ... --allow-role <role_name>
----

Example of creating a new role named `red`:
[,bash]
----
rpk security role create red
----

[,bash,role=no-copy]

=== Delete a role

When a role is deleted, Redpanda carries out the following actions automatically:

- All role ACLs are deleted.
- All users' assignments to the role are removed.

Redpanda lists all impacted ACLs and role assignments when running this command. You receive a prompt to confirm the deletion action. The delete operation is irreversible.

=== Assign a role

You can assign a role to any security principal. Principals are referred to using the format: `Type:Name`. Redpanda currently supports only the `User` type. If you omit the type, Redpanda assumes the `User` type by default. With this command, you can assign the role to multiple principals at the same time by using a comma separator between each principal.

=== Unassign a role

You can remove a role assignment from a security principal without deleting the role. Principals are referred to using the format: `Type:Name`. Redpanda currently supports only the `User` type. If you omit the type, Redpanda assumes the `User` type by default. With this command, you can remove the role from multiple principals at the same time by using a comma separator between each principal.

=== Edit role permissions

You can add or remove ACLs from any of the roles you have previously created.

[tabs]
====
rpk::
+
--
To modify an existing role by adding additional ACLs to it, run:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create ... --allow-role <role_name>
----

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create ... --deny-role <role_name>
----

To use `rpk` to remove ACLs from a role, run:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl delete ... --allow-role <role_name>
rpk security acl delete ... --deny-role <role_name>
----

When you run `rpk security acl delete`, Redpanda deletes all ACLs matching the parameters supplied. Make sure to match the exact ACL you want to delete. If you supply only the `--allow-role` flag, for example, Redpanda will delete every ACL granting that role authorization to a resource.

To list all the ACLs associated with a role, run:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl list --allow-role <role_name> --deny-role <role_name>
----
