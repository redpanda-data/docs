== RBAC overview

RBAC is designed to address the critical challenge of access management at scale. It alleviates the process of manually maintaining and verifying a set of raw permissions (access control lists, or ACLs) for a user base that could contain thousands of users. RBAC provides a method to onboard new employees easier, audit accesses faster, and adapt more readily to evolutions of usage and compliance needs.

Using RBAC, you can define roles to reflect organizational structure or job duties. This approach decouples users and permissions through the assignment of roles. RBAC allows a one-to-many mapping of a given role to many users, dramatically reducing the number of custom policies needed for a resource from one per user, to one per group of users.

=== RBAC terminology

Under the RBAC framework, you create *roles*, grant *permissions* to those roles, and assign the roles to *users*. When you change the permissions for a given role, all users with that role automatically gain the modified permissions. You grant or deny permissions for a role by creating an ACL and specifying the RBAC role as either allowed or denied  respectively.

Redpanda treats all *users* as security principals and defines them with the `Type:Name` syntax (for example, `User:mike`). You can omit the `Type` when defining a principal and Redpanda will assume the `User:` type. All examples here use the full syntax for clarity.

See xref:security/authorization/acl.adoc[access control lists] for more information on defining ACLs and working with principals.

==== Roles

A role is a named collection of ACLs which may have users (security principals) assigned to it. You can assign any number of roles to a given user. When installing a new Redpanda cluster, no roles are provisioned by default. 

ifndef::env-cloud[]
If you want to use RBAC, you must create your first roles using your `superuser` account, which enables you to create additional roles and assign appropriate ACLs as necessary. See xref:security/authentication.adoc#create_superusers[configure authentication] for more information on creating and managing superusers.

endif::[]

When performing an upgrade from older versions of Redpanda, all existing SASL/SCRAM users are assigned to the placeholder `Users` role to help you more readily migrate away from pure ACLs. As a security measure, this default role has no assigned ACLs. 

==== Policy conflicts

You can assign a combination of ACLs and roles to any given principal. ACLs allow permissions, deny permissions, or specify a combination of both. As a result, users may at times have role assignments with conflicting policies. If this situation arises, the user is permitted to perform an operation if and only if:

* There does not exist a DENY permission matching the operation.
* There exists an ALLOW permission matching the operation.

=== RBAC example

Consider a scenario where your software engineers use a set of private topics to publish application update information to users. All your private topics begin with the prefix `private-`. You might create a new `SoftwareEng` role to represent the software engineers with write access to these private topics. You would then assign the `SoftwareEng` role as the allowed role for a new ACL specifying read and write permissions to `private-*`. Using a wildcard includes all existing private topics and any new ones you might create later. You then assign the new role to John and Jane, your two software engineers who will write messages to this topic. The `rpk` commands to accomplish this are:

[,bash]
----
rpk security role create SoftwareEng &&
rpk security acl create --operation read --operation write --topic private-* --allow-role SoftwareEng &&
rpk security role assign SoftwareEng --principal User:john,User:jane
----

This diagram shows the relationships between users, roles, and ACLs:

image::shared:rbac-roles.png[RBAC role assignments]

Consider the situation where you want to create a new topic, `private-software-versions`, where users self-report the version of a component they are using. If you were using the ACL authorization mechanism, you would need to assign this ACL to every user in your Redpanda installation. Using RBAC allows you to make one update and apply it to everyone with that role. Adding the write permissions for this topic to the `User` role means everyone with that role (all authenticated users in the diagram) gains the authorization immediately. For example:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create --operation write --topic private-software-versions --allow-role User
----

== Manage users and roles

Administrators can manage RBAC configurations with `rpk`, the Redpanda Admin API, or {ui}.

=== Create a role

Creating a new role is a two-step process. First you define the role, giving it a unique and descriptive name. Second, you assign one or more ACLs to allow or deny access for the new role. This defines the permissions that are inherited by all users assigned to the role. It is possible to have an empty role with no ACLs assigned.

rpk::

--
To create a new role, run:

[,bash]
----
rpk security role create <role_name>
----

After the role is created, administrators create new ACLs and assign this role either allow or deny permissions. For example:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create ... --allow-role <role_name>
----

Example of creating a new role named `red`:
[,bash]
----
rpk security role create red
----

[,bash,role=no-copy]

=== Delete a role

When a role is deleted, Redpanda carries out the following actions automatically:

- All role ACLs are deleted.
- All users' assignments to the role are removed.

Redpanda lists all impacted ACLs and role assignments when running this command. You receive a prompt to confirm the deletion action. The delete operation is irreversible.

=== Assign a role

You can assign a role to any security principal. Principals are referred to using the format: `Type:Name`. Redpanda currently supports only the `User` type. If you omit the type, Redpanda assumes the `User` type by default. With this command, you can assign the role to multiple principals at the same time by using a comma separator between each principal.

=== Unassign a role

You can remove a role assignment from a security principal without deleting the role. Principals are referred to using the format: `Type:Name`. Redpanda currently supports only the `User` type. If you omit the type, Redpanda assumes the `User` type by default. With this command, you can remove the role from multiple principals at the same time by using a comma separator between each principal.

=== Edit role permissions

You can add or remove ACLs from any of the roles you have previously created.

ifndef::env-cloud[]

rpk::

--
To modify an existing role by adding additional ACLs to it, run:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create ... --allow-role <role_name>
----

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create ... --deny-role <role_name>
----

To use `rpk` to remove ACLs from a role, run:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl delete ... --allow-role <role_name>
rpk security acl delete ... --deny-role <role_name>
----

When you run `rpk security acl delete`, Redpanda deletes all ACLs matching the parameters supplied. Make sure to match the exact ACL you want to delete. If you supply only the `--allow-role` flag, for example, Redpanda will delete every ACL granting that role authorization to a resource.

To list all the ACLs associated with a role, run:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl list --allow-role <role_name> --deny-role <role_name>
----
