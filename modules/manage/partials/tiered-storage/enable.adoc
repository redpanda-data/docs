You can enable Tiered Storage for a cluster or a topic.

Topic-level properties override cluster-level properties. For example, if you have Tiered Storage enabled for the cluster and you create a topic with Tiered Storage turned off, it is also turned off for that topic. When cluster-level properties are changed, the changes apply only to new topics, not existing topics.

==== Enable Tiered Storage for a cluster

When you enable Tiered Storage for a cluster, it is enabled for all existing topics in the cluster.

To enable Tiered Storage for a cluster, set the following cluster-level properties to `true`:

* <ClusterProperty name="cloud_storage_enabled" frontmatter={props.frontmatter}/>
* <TunableClusterProperty name="cloud_storage_enable_remote_write" frontmatter={props.frontmatter}/>
* <TunableClusterProperty name="cloud_storage_enable_remote_read" frontmatter={props.frontmatter}/>

==== Enable Tiered Storage for topics

To enable Tiered Storage for specific topics, use the following topic-level properties:

|===
| Property | Description

| `redpanda.remote.write`
| Uploads data from Redpanda to cloud storage. Overrides the cluster-level <TunableClusterProperty name="cloud_storage_enable_remote_write" frontmatter={props.frontmatter}/> configuration for the topic.

| `redpanda.remote.read`
| Fetches data from cloud storage to Redpanda. Overrides the cluster-level <TunableClusterProperty name="cloud_storage_enable_remote_read" frontmatter={props.frontmatter}/> configuration for the topic.

| `redpanda.remote.recovery`
| Recovers or reproduces a topic from cloud storage. Use this flag during topic creation. It does not apply to existing topics.

| `redpanda.remote.delete`
| When set to `true`, deleting a topic also deletes its objects in remote storage. Both `redpanda.remote.write` and `redpanda.remote.read` must be enabled, and the topic must not be a Remote Read Replica topic. +
 +
When set to `false`, deleting a topic does not delete its objects in remote storage.  +
 +
Default is `true` for new topics.
|===

Topic configuration flags override any cluster-level configuration. For example, for new topics, if <TunableClusterProperty name="cloud_storage_enable_remote_write" frontmatter={props.frontmatter}/> is set to `true`, you can set `redpanda.remote.write` to `false` to turn it off for a particular topic. Or, if you have Tiered Storage turned off for the cluster, you can enable it for individual topics with the topic flags. When cluster-level properties are changed, the changes apply only to new topics, not existing topics.

The following table lists outcomes for combinations of cluster-level and topic-level configurations:

*Table 1: Remote write configuration*

|===
| Cluster-level configuration +
(`cloud_storage_enable_remote_write`) | Topic-level configuration +
(`redpanda.remote.write`) | Outcome +
(whether remote write is enabled +
or disabled on the topic)

| `true`
| Not set
| Enabled

| `true`
| `false`
| Disabled

| `true`
| `true`
| Enabled

| `false`
| Not set
| Disabled

| `false`
| `false`
| Disabled

| `false`
| `true`
| Enabled
|===

*Table 2: Remote read configuration*

|===
| Cluster-level configuration +
(`cloud_storage_enable_remote_read`) | Topic-level configuration +
(`redpanda.remote.read`) | Outcome +
(whether remote read is enabled +
or disabled on the topic)

| `true`
| Not set
| Enabled

| `true`
| `false`
| Disabled

| `true`
| `true`
| Enabled

| `false`
| Not set
| Disabled

| `false`
| `false`
| Disabled

| `false`
| `true`
| Enabled
|===

The cluster-level <ClusterProperty name="cloud_storage_enabled" frontmatter={props.frontmatter}/> property must be set to `true` to enable Tiered Storage at either the cluster level or the topic level. To disable Tiered Storage at the cluster level and enable it on specific topics, this property must still be set to `true`.

* If this property is set to `false`, nothing is added to cloud storage, regardless of whether or not the other Tiered Storage properties are enabled.
* If this property is set to `true` and the other Tiered Storage properties are disabled, then the Tiered Storage subsystem is initialized, but it is not used until you enable Tiered Storage for a topic or at the cluster level.

To enable Tiered Storage on a topic, set the `redpanda.remote.write` and `redpanda.remote.read` flags on a new or existing topic.

To create a new topic with Tiered Storage enabled:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic create <topic_name> -c redpanda.remote.read=true -c redpanda.remote.write=true
----

To enable Tiered Storage on an existing topic, run both of these commands:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic alter-config <topic_name> --set redpanda.remote.read=true &&
rpk topic alter-config <topic_name> --set redpanda.remote.write=true
----
