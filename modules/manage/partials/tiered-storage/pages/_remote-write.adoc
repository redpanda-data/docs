Remote write is the process that constantly uploads log segments to object storage. The process is created for each partition and runs on the leader broker of the partition. It only uploads the segments that contain offsets that are smaller than the last stable offset. This is the latest offset that the client can read.

To ensure all data is uploaded, you must enable remote write before any data is produced to the topic. If remote write is not enabled, data may be deleted due to retention settings.

To enable Tiered Storage, use remote write and remote read.

:::note
If you only enable remote write on a topic, you have a simple backup that you can use for recovery. See <Link to={props.frontmatter.deployment=='Kubernetes'? props.frontmatter.linkRoot + 'manage/kubernetes/data-archiving' : props.frontmatter.linkRoot + 'manage/data-archiving'}>Data Archiving</Link>.

To create a topic with remote write enabled:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic create <topic_name> -c redpanda.remote.write=true
----

To enable remote write on an existing topic:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic alter-config <topic_name> --set redpanda.remote.write=true
----

If remote write is enabled, log segments are not deleted until they're uploaded to object storage. Because of this, the log segments may exceed the configured retention period until they're uploaded, so the topic might require more disk space. This prevents data loss if segments cannot be uploaded fast enough or if the retention period is very short.

:::tip
A constant stream of data is necessary to build up the log segments and roll them into object storage. To see new log segments faster, you can edit the `segment.bytes` topic-level property. Or, you can edit the <TunableClusterProperty name="cloud_storage_segment_max_upload_interval_sec" frontmatter={props.frontmatter}/> cluster-level property, which sets the frequency with which new segments are generated in Tiered Storage, even if the local segment has not exceeded the `segment.bytes` size or the `segment.ms` age.

:::note
Starting in version 22.3, when you delete a topic in Redpanda, the data is also deleted in object storage. See <<enable-tiered-storage-for-topics,Enable Tiered Storage for a topic>>.
