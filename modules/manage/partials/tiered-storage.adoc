Tiered Storage helps to lower storage costs by offloading log segments to object storage. You can specify the amount of storage you want to retain in local storage. You don't need to specify which log segments you want to move, because Redpanda moves them automatically based on cluster-level configuration properties. Tiered Storage indexes where data is offloaded, so it can look up the data when you need it.

The following image illustrates the Tiered Storage architecture: remote write uploads data from Redpanda to object storage, and remote read fetches data from object storage to Redpanda.

image::shared:tiered_storage1.png[Tiered Storage architecture]

[IMPORTANT]
====
- When upgrading to Redpanda 23.2, uploads to object storage are paused until all brokers in the cluster are upgraded. If the cluster gets stuck while upgrading, roll it back to the original version. In a mixed-version state, the cluster could run out of disk space. If you need to force a mixed-version cluster to upload, move partition leadership to brokers running the original version.
====

== Prerequisites

include::shared:partial$enterprise-license.adoc[]

To check if you already have a license key applied to your cluster:

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster license info
----

== Set up Tiered Storage

To set up Tiered Storage:

. <<configure-object-storage,Configure object storage>>.
. <<enable-tiered-storage,Enable Tiered Storage>>. You can enable Tiered Storage for the cluster (all topics) or for specific topics.
. <<set-retention-limits,Set retention limits>>.

=== Configure object storage

Redpanda natively supports Tiered Storage with Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Google Cloud Storage (GCS, which uses the Google Cloud Platform S3 API), and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage (ABS) and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS).

[NOTE]
====
- Migrating topics from one object storage provider to another is not supported.
- Migrating topics from one bucket or container to another is not supported.

==== Amazon S3

TIP: If deploying Redpanda on an AWS Auto-Scaling group (ASG), keep in mind that the ASG controller terminates nodes and spins up replacements if the nodes saturate and are unable to heartbeat the controller (based on the EC2 health check). For more information, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html#types-of-instance-status-checks[AWS documentation^]. Redpanda recommends deploying on Linux or Kubernetes. For more information, see xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/index.adoc[Deploy Redpanda].

You can configure access to Amazon S3 with either an IAM role attached to the instance or with access keys.

To configure access to an S3 bucket with an IAM role:

. Configure an xref:manage:security/iam-roles.adoc#configuring-iam-roles[IAM role].

. Override the following required cluster properties in the Helm chart:

==== Microsoft ABS/ADLS


NOTE: Starting in release 23.2.8, Redpanda supports storage accounts configured for ADLS Gen2 with https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-namespace[hierarchical namespaces^] enabled. For hierarchical namespaces created with a custom endpoint, set the properties `cloud_storage_azure_adls_endpoint` and `cloud_storage_azure_adls_port` in the Helm chart through the command line (`--set storage.tieredConfig`) or the YAML file. If you haven't configured custom endpoints in Azure, there's no need to edit these properties.

To configure access to ABS/ADLS, use shared keys:

. Get an account access key for the Azure container you want Redpanda. For information on how to view your account access keys, see the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json&tabs=azure-portal#view-account-access-keys[Azure documentation^].

For additional properties, see <<Tiered Storage configuration properties>>.

=== Enable Tiered Storage

. To enable Tiered Storage, set config_ref:cloud_storage_enabled,true,cluster-properties[] to `true`.
. Configure topics for Tiered Storage. You can configure either all topics in a cluster or only specific topics.
* <<Enable Tiered Storage for a cluster>>
* <<Enable Tiered Storage for specific topics>>

==== Enable Tiered Storage for a cluster

To enable Tiered Storage for a cluster (in addition to setting `cloud_storage_enabled` to `true`), set the following cluster-level properties to `true`:

* config_ref:cloud_storage_enable_remote_write,true,tunable-properties[]
* config_ref:cloud_storage_enable_remote_read,true,tunable-properties[]

When you enable Tiered Storage for a cluster, you enable it for all existing topics in the cluster. When cluster-level properties are changed, the changes apply only to new topics, not existing topics.

NOTE: The `cloud_storage_enable_remote_write` and `cloud_storage_enable_remote_read` cluster-level properties are essentially creation-time defaults for the `redpanda.remote.write` and `redpanda.remote.read` topic-level properties.

==== Enable Tiered Storage for specific topics

To enable Tiered Storage for a new or existing topic (in addition to setting `cloud_storage_enabled` to `true`), set the following topic-level properties to `true`:

* `redpanda.remote.write`
* `redpanda.remote.read`

For example, to create a new topic with Tiered Storage:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic create <topic_name> -c redpanda.remote.read=true -c redpanda.remote.write=true
----

To enable Tiered Storage on an existing topic, run:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic alter-config <topic_name> --set redpanda.remote.read=true --set redpanda.remote.write=true
----

Topic-level properties override cluster-level properties. For example, for new topics, if `cloud_storage_enable_remote_write` is set to `true`, you can set `redpanda.remote.write` to `false` to turn it off for a particular topic.

Tiered Storage topic-level properties:

|===
| Property | Description

| `redpanda.remote.write`
| Uploads data from Redpanda to object storage. Overrides the cluster-level `cloud_storage_enable_remote_write` configuration for the topic.

| `redpanda.remote.read`
| Fetches data from object storage to Redpanda. Overrides the cluster-level `cloud_storage_enable_remote_read` configuration for the topic.

| `redpanda.remote.recovery`
| Recovers or reproduces a topic from object storage. Use this property during topic creation. It does not apply to existing topics.

| `redpanda.remote.delete`
| When set to `true`, deleting a topic also deletes its objects in object storage. Both `redpanda.remote.write` and `redpanda.remote.read` must be enabled, and the topic must not be a Remote Read Replica topic.

When set to `false`, deleting a topic does not delete its objects in object storage.

Default is `true` for new topics.
|===

The following tables list outcomes for combinations of cluster-level and topic-level configurations:

|===
| Cluster-level configuration with `cloud_storage_enable_remote_write` | Topic-level configuration with `redpanda.remote.write` | Outcome: whether remote write is enabled or disabled on the topic

|===


=== Set retention limits

Redpanda supports retention limits and compaction for topics using Tiered Storage. Set retention limits to purge topic data after it reaches a specified age or size.

Starting in Redpanda version 22.3, object storage is the default storage tier for all streaming data, and retention properties work the same for Tiered Storage topics and local storage topics. Data is retained in object storage until it reaches the configured time or size limit.

Data becomes eligible for deletion from object storage following `retention.ms` or `retention.bytes`. For example, if `retention.bytes` is set to 10 GiB, then every partition in the topic has a limit of 10 GiB in object storage. When `retention.bytes` is exceeded by data in object storage, the data in object storage is trimmed. If neither `retention.ms` nor `retention.bytes` is specified, then cluster-level defaults are used.

[NOTE]
====
- During upgrade, Redpanda preserves retention settings for existing topics.
- Both size-based and time-based retention policies are applied simultaneously, so it's possible for your size-based property to override your time-based property, or vice versa. For example, if your size-based property requires removing one segment, and your time-based property requires removing three segments, then three segments are removed. Size-based properties reclaim disk space as close as possible to the maximum size, without exceeding the limit.

==== Compacted topics in Tiered Storage

When you set xref:reference:topic-properties.adoc#cleanuppolicy[`cleanup.policy`] for a topic to `compact`, nothing gets deleted from object storage based on retention settings. When set to `compact,delete`, compacted segments are deleted from object storage based on `retention.ms` and `retention.bytes`.

For compacted topics, Redpanda compacts segments after they have been uploaded to object storage. Redpanda initially uploads all uncompacted segments. It then re-uploads the segments with compaction applied. It's likely that some segments in object storage are not compacted, but the Tiered Storage read path can manage this.

==== Manage local capacity for Tiered Storage topics

You can use properties to control retention of topic data in local storage. With Tiered Storage enabled, data in local storage expires after the topic-level properties `retention.local.target.ms` or `retention.local.target.bytes`. (These settings are equivalent to `retention.ms` and `retention.bytes` without Tiered Storage.)

You can also use the cluster-level properties `retention_local_target_ms_default` and `retention_local_target_bytes_default`. Settings can depend on the size of your drive, how many partitions you have, and how much data you keep for each partition.

When set, Redpanda keeps actively-used and sequential (next segment) data in local cache and targets to maintain this age of data in local storage. It purges data based on actual available local volume space, without forcing disk full situations when there is data skew.

At topic creation with Tiered Storage enabled:

* If `retention.ms` or `retention.bytes` is set, Redpanda initializes the `retention.local.target.*` properties.
* If `retention.local.target.ms` or `retention.local.target.bytes` is set, Redpanda initializes the `min(retention.bytes, retention.local.target.bytes)` and `max(retention.ms, retention.local.target.ms)` properties.
* If properties are not specified:
** Starting in version 22.3, new topics use the default retention values of one day for local storage (`retention_local_target_ms_default`) and seven days for all storage, including object storage (`delete_retention_ms`).
** Upgraded topics retain their historical defaults of infinite retention.

After topic configuration, if Tiered Storage was disabled and must be enabled, or was enabled and must be disabled, Redpanda uses the local retention properties set for the topic.

== View space usage

Use xref:reference:rpk/rpk-cluster/rpk-cluster-logdirs-describe.adoc[`rpk cluster logdirs describe`] to get details about Tiered Storage space usage in both object storage and local disk. The directories for object storage start with `remote://<bucket_name>`. For example:

```bash
rpk cluster logdirs describe

BROKER  DIR                              TOPIC               PARTITION  SIZE      ERROR

1       remote://data                    monday              0          60051220
2       /home/redpanda/var/node2/data    monday              0          17169935
2       remote://data                    monday              0          60051220
```

=== Integration with space utilization tools

Third-party tools that query space utilization from the Redpanda cluster might not handle `remote://` entries properly. Redpanda space usage is reported from each broker, but object storage is shared between brokers. Third-party tools could over-count storage and show unexpectedly high disk usage for Tiered Storage topics. In this situation, you can disable output of `remote://` entries by setting `kafka_enable_describe_log_dirs_remote_storage` to `false`.

== Remote write

Remote write is the process that constantly uploads log segments to object storage. The process is created for each partition and runs on the leader broker of the partition. It only uploads the segments that contain offsets that are smaller than the last stable offset. This is the latest offset that the client can read.

To ensure all data is uploaded, you must enable remote write before any data is produced to the topic. If remote write is not enabled, data may be deleted due to retention settings.

To enable Tiered Storage, use remote write and remote read.

NOTE: If you only enable remote write on a topic, you have a simple backup that you can use for recovery. See xref:{data-archiving-link}[Data Archiving].

To create a topic with remote write enabled:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic create <topic_name> -c redpanda.remote.write=true
----

To enable remote write on an existing topic:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic alter-config <topic_name> --set redpanda.remote.write=true
----

If remote write is enabled, log segments are not deleted until they're uploaded to object storage. Because of this, the log segments may exceed the configured retention period until they're uploaded, so the topic might require more disk space. This prevents data loss if segments cannot be uploaded fast enough or if the retention period is very short.

TIP: A constant stream of data is necessary to build up the log segments and roll them into object storage. To see new log segments faster, you can edit the `segment.bytes` topic-level property. Or, you can edit the config_ref:cloud_storage_segment_max_upload_interval_sec,true,tunable-properties[] cluster-level property, which sets the frequency with which new segments are generated in Tiered Storage, even if the local segment has not exceeded the `segment.bytes` size or the `segment.ms` age.

NOTE: Starting in version 22.3, when you delete a topic in Redpanda, the data is also deleted in object storage. See <<Enable Tiered Storage for specific topics>>.

=== Idle timeout

You can configure Redpanda to start a remote write periodically. This is useful if the ingestion rate is low and the segments are kept open for long periods of time. You specify a number of seconds for the timeout, and if that time has passed since the previous write and the partition has new data, Redpanda starts a new write. This limits data loss in the event of catastrophic failure and adds a guarantee that you only lose the specified number of seconds of data.

Setting idle timeout to a very short interval can create a lot of small files, which can affect throughput. If you decide to set a value for idle timeout, start with 600 seconds, which prevents the creation of so many small files that throughput is affected when you recover the files.

Use the config_ref:cloud_storage_segment_max_upload_interval_sec,true,tunable-properties[] property to set the number of seconds for idle timeout. If this property is empty, Redpanda uploads metadata to object storage, but the segment is not uploaded until it reaches the `segment.bytes` size. By default, the property is null.

=== Reconciliation

Reconciliation is a Redpanda process that monitors partitions and decides which partitions are uploaded on each broker to guarantee that data is uploaded only once. It runs periodically on every broker. It also balances the workload evenly between brokers.

NOTE: The broker uploading to object storage is always with the partition leader. Therefore, when partition leadership balancing occurs, Redpanda stops uploads to object storage from one broker and starts uploads on another broker.

=== Upload backlog controller

Remote write uses a proportional derivative (PD) controller to minimize the backlog size for the write. The backlog consists of data that has not been uploaded to object storage but must be uploaded eventually.

The upload backlog controller prevents Redpanda from running out of disk space. If `remote.write` is set to `true`, Redpanda cannot evict log segments that have not been uploaded to object storage. If the remote write process cannot keep up with the amount of data that needs to be uploaded to object storage, the upload backlog controller increases priority for the upload process. The upload backlog controller measures the size of the upload periodically and tunes the priority of the remote write process.

== Remote read

Remote read fetches data from object storage using the Kafka API.

Without Tiered Storage, when data is evicted locally, it is no longer available. If the consumer starts consuming the partition from the beginning, the first offset is the smallest offset available locally. However, when Tiered Storage is enabled with the `redpanda.remote.read` and `redpanda.remote.write` properties, data is always uploaded to object storage before it's deleted. This guarantees that data is always available either locally or remotely.

When data is available remotely and Tiered Storage is enabled, clients can consume data, even if the data is no longer stored locally.

To create a topic with remote read enabled:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic create <topic_name> -c -c redpanda.remote.read=true
----

To enable remote read on an existing topic:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic alter-config <topic_name> --set redpanda.remote.read=true
----

See also: xref:manage:kubernetes/remote-read-replicas.adoc[Remote Read Replicas]

=== Caching

When a client fetches an offset range that isn't available locally in the Redpanda data directory, Redpanda downloads remote segments from object storage. These downloaded segments are stored in the object storage cache directory.

The cache directory is created in the Redpanda `data` directory by default, but it can be placed anywhere in the system. For example, you might want to put the cache directory on a dedicated drive with cheaper storage. If you don't specify a cache location in the `redpanda.yaml` file, the cache directory is created in `<redpanda_data_directory>/cloud_storage_cache`. Use the config_ref:cloud_storage_cache_directory,true,node-properties[] property on each broker to specify a different location for the cache directory. You must specify the full path.

Redpanda checks the cache periodically, and if the size of the stored data is larger than the configured limit, the eviction process starts. The eviction process removes segments that haven't been accessed recently, until the size of the cache drops 20%.

==== Chunking remote segments

To support more concurrent consumers of historical data with less local storage, Redpanda can download small chunks of remote segments to the cache directory. For example, when a client fetch request spans a subsection of a 1 GiB segment, instead of downloading the entire 1 GiB segment, Redpanda can download 16 MiB chunks that contain just enough data required to fulfill the fetch request.

The paths on disk to a chunk are structured as `p_chunks/\{chunk_start_offset}`, where `p` is the original path to the segment in the object storage cache. The `_chunks` subdirectory holds chunk files identified by the chunk start offset. These files can be reclaimed by the cache eviction process during the normal eviction path.

==== Chunk eviction strategies

A chunk that isn't shared with any data source can be evicted from the cache, so space is returned to disk. Select a chunk eviction strategy with the configuration property `cloud_storage_chunk_eviction_strategy`:

- `eager`: Evicts chunks that aren't shared with other data sources. Eviction is fast, because no sorting is involved. This is the default.
- `capped`: Evicts chunks until the number of hydrated chunks is below or equal to the maximum hydrated chunks at a time. (This limit is for each segment and calculated using `cloud_storage_hydrated_chunks_per_segment_ratio` by the remote segment.) Eviction is fastest, because no sorting is involved, and the process stops after the cap is reached.
- `predictive`: Uses statistics from readers to determine which chunks to evict. Chunks that aren't in use are sorted by the count of readers that will use the chunk in the future. The counts are populated by readers using the chunk data source. The chunks that are least expensive to re-hydrate are then evicted, taking into account the maximum hydrated chunk count. Eviction is slowest, because chunks are sorted before evicting them.

==== Caching and chunking properties

Use the following cluster-level properties to set the maximum cache size, the cache check interval, and chunking qualities.
ifndef::env-kubernetes[Edit them with the `rpk cluster config edit` command.]

|===
| Property      | Description

| config_ref:cloud_storage_cache_check_interval,true,tunable-properties[]
| The time, in milliseconds, between cache checks. The size of the cache can grow quickly, so it's important to have a small interval between checks. However, if the checks are too frequent, they consume a lot of resources. Default is 30000 ms (30 sec).

| config_ref:cloud_storage_cache_chunk_size,true,tunable-properties[]
| The size of a chunk downloaded into object storage cache. Default is 16 MiB.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_cache_size_percent,true,cluster-properties[]
| Maximum size (as a percentage) of the disk cache used by Tiered Storage. + \nThis property overrides `cloud_storage_cache_size`. Default is 10%.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_cache_size,true,cluster-properties[]
| Maximum size (in bytes) of the disk cache used by Tiered Storage. Default is 20 GiB.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_chunk_eviction_strategy,true,tunable-properties[]
| Strategy for evicting unused cache chunks, either `eager` (default), `capped`, or `predictive`.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_disable_chunk_reads,true,tunable-properties[]
| Flag to turn off chunk-based reads and enable full-segment downloads.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_hydrated_chunks_per_segment_ratio,true,tunable-properties[]
| The ratio of hydrated to non-hydrated chunks for each segment, where a current ratio above this value results in unused chunks being evicted. Default is 0.7.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_min_chunks_per_segment_threshold,true,tunable-properties[]
| The threshold below which all chunks of a segment can be hydrated without eviction. If the number of chunks in a segment is below this threshold, the segment is small enough that all chunks in it can be hydrated at any given time. Default is 5.

ifdef::env-kubernetes[]
To specify a different volume for the cache directory, use one of the following:

- PersistentVolume
- `hostPath` volume

==== PersistentVolume

A PersistentVolume is storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using StorageClasses.
For details about PersistentVolumes, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/[Kubernetes documentation^].

You can configure the Helm chart to use a PersistentVolume for the cache directory with either a static provisioner or a dynamic provisioner.

===== Dynamic provisioners

A dynamic provisioner creates a PersistentVolume on demand for each Redpanda broker.

Managed Kubernetes platforms and cloud environments usually provide a dynamic provisioner.
If you are running Kubernetes on-premises, make sure that you have a dynamic provisioner for your storage type.

. Make sure that you have at least one StorageClass in the cluster:
+
```bash
kubectl get storageclass
```
+
Example output:
+
In a Google GKE cluster, this is the result:
+
[.no-copy]
----
NAME                 PROVISIONER            AGE
standard (default)   kubernetes.io/gce-pd   1d
----
+
This StorageClass is marked as the default, which means that this class is used to provision a PersistentVolume when the PersistentVolumeClaim doesn't specify the StorageClass.

. Configure the Helm chart with your StorageClass:

- To use your Kubernetes cluster's default StorageClass, set `storage.persistentVolume.storageClass` to an empty string (`""`):

===== Static provisioners

When you use a static provisioner, an existing PersistentVolume in the cluster is selected and bound to one PersistentVolumeClaim for each Redpanda broker.

. Create one PersistentVolume for each Redpanda broker. Make sure to create PersistentVolumes with a capacity of at least the value of the `storage.tieredConfig.cloud_storage_cache_size` configuration.

. Set the `storage.tieredStoragePersistentVolume.storageClass` to a dash (`"-"`) to use a PersistentVolume with a static provisioner:

==== hostPath

A hostPath volume mounts a file or directory from the host node's file system into your Pod.
For details about hostPath volumes, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath[Kubernetes documentation^].

To use a hostPath volume for the cache directory:

. Set the `storage.tieredStorageHostPath` configuration to the absolute path of a file on the local worker node.
. Set `storage.tieredStoragePersistentVolume.enabled` to `false`.
. Set `statefulset.initContainers.setDataDirOwnership.enabled` to `true`.

== Disaster recovery

When you create a topic, you can use remote recovery to download the topic data from object storage. You can also use remote recovery to restore a topic that was deleted from a cluster.

CAUTION: Remote recovery is not intended to be a fully-functional disaster recovery solution. It is only safe when no other clusters are still writing to the specified bucket or container. Recovery does not provide snapshot-style consistency: some partitions in some topics will be more up to date than others. For example, restoring a consumer offsets topic could have offsets that point ahead of the restored data.

To create a new topic using remote recovery:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic create <topic_name> -c redpanda.remote.recovery=true
----

To create a new topic using remote recovery and enable Tiered Storage on the new topic with the `redpanda.remote.write` and `redpanda.remote.read` properties:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic create <topic_name> -c redpanda.remote.recovery=true -c redpanda.remote.write=true -c redpanda.remote.read=true
----

== Retries and backoff

If the object storage provider replies with an error message that the server is busy, Redpanda retries the request. Redpanda may retry on other errors, depending on the object storage provider.

Redpanda always uses exponential backoff with cloud connections. You can configure the config_ref:cloud_storage_initial_backoff_ms,true,tunable-properties[] property to set the time used as an initial backoff interval in the exponential backoff algorithm to handle an error. Default is 100 ms.

== Transport

Tiered Storage creates a connection pool for each CPU that limits simultaneous connections to the object storage provider. It also uses persistent HTTP connections with a configurable maximum idle time. A custom S3 client is used to send and receive data.

For normal usage, you do not need to configure the transport properties. The Redpanda defaults are sufficient, and the certificates used to connect to the object storage client are available through public key infrastructure. Redpanda detects the location of the CA certificates automatically.

Redpanda uses the following properties to configure transport.

ifndef::env-kubernetes[Edit them with the `rpk cluster config edit` command.]

|===
| Property | Description

| config_ref:cloud_storage_max_connections,true,cluster-properties[]
| The maximum number of connections to object storage on a broker for each CPU. Remote read and remote write share the same pool of connections. This means that if a connection is used to upload a segment, it cannot be used to download another segment. If this value is too small, some workloads might starve for connections, which results in delayed uploads and downloads. If this value is too large, Redpanda tries to upload a lot of files at the same time and might overwhelm the system. Default is 20.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_segment_upload_timeout_ms,true,tunable-properties[]
| Timeout for segment upload. Redpanda retries the upload after the timeout. Default is 30000 ms.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_manifest_upload_timeout_ms,true,tunable-properties[]
| Timeout for manifest upload. Redpanda retries the upload after the timeout. Default is 10000 ms.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_max_connection_idle_time_ms,true,tunable-properties[]
| The maximum idle time for persistent HTTP connections. This differs depending on the object storage provider. Default is 5000 ms, which is sufficient for most providers.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_segment_max_upload_interval_sec,true,tunable-properties[]
| The number of seconds for idle timeout. If this property is empty, Redpanda uploads metadata to the object storage, but the segment is not uploaded until it reaches the `segment.bytes` size. By default, the property is empty.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_trust_file,true,cluster-properties[]
| The public certificate used to validate the TLS connection to object storage. If this is empty, Redpanda uses your operating system's CA cert pool.
|===

== Object storage housekeeping

To improve performance and scalability, Redpanda performs object storage housekeeping when the system is idle. This housekeeping includes adjacent segment merging, which analyzes the data layout of the partition in object storage. If it finds a run of small segments, it can merge and reupload the segment.

To determine when the system is idle for housekeeping, Redpanda constantly calculates object storage utilization using the moving average with a sliding window algorithm. The width of the sliding window is defined by the config_ref:cloud_storage_idle_timeout_ms,true,tunable-properties[] property, which has a default of 10 seconds. If the utilization (requests per second) drops below the threshold, then object storage is considered idle, and object storage housekeeping begins. The threshold is defined by the config_ref:cloud_storage_idle_threshold_rps,true,tunable-properties[] property, which has a default of one request per second. Object storage is considered idle if, during the last 10 seconds, there were 10 or less object storage API requests.

If the object storage API becomes active after housekeeping begins, then housekeeping is paused until it becomes idle again. If object storage is not idle for config_ref:cloud_storage_housekeeping_interval_ms,true,tunable-properties[], then housekeeping is forced to run until it completes. This guarantees that all housekeeping jobs are run once for every `cloud_storage_housekeeping_interval_ms`.

=== Adjacent segment merging

By default, and as part of this object storage housekeeping, Redpanda runs adjacent segment merging on all segments in object storage that are smaller than the threshold. Two properties control the behavior of config_ref:cloud_storage_enable_segment_merging,true,tunable-properties[]:

* config_ref:cloud_storage_segment_size_target,true,tunable-properties[]: The desired segment size in object storage. The default segment size is the local segment size for the topic, which is controlled by the config_ref:log_segment_size,true,tunable-properties[] configuration property and the `segment.bytes` topic property. You can set the `cloud_storage_segment_size_target` property to a value larger than the default segment size, but because this triggers a lot of segment re-uploads, it's not recommended.
* config_ref:cloud_storage_segment_size_min,true,tunable-properties[]: The smallest segment size that Redpanda keeps in object storage. The default is 50% of config_ref:log_segment_size,true,tunable-properties[].

If the adjacent segment merging job finds a run of small segments, it can perform one of the following operations:

* Merge and re-upload a segment with a size up to `cloud_storage_segment_size_target`.
* Merge and re-upload a segment with a size less than `cloud_storage_segment_size_min` if there are no other options (the run of small segments is followed by the large segment).
* Wait until new segments are added if the run is at the end of the partition.

Suppose the config_ref:cloud_storage_segment_max_upload_interval_sec,true,tunable-properties[] property is set and the partition contains a large number of small segments. For example, if `cloud_storage_segment_max_upload_interval_ms` is set to 10 minutes and the produce rate is 1 MiB per minute, then Redpanda uploads a new 10 MiB segment every 10 minutes. If adjacent segment merging is enabled and `cloud_storage_segment_size_target` is set to 500 MiB, then every 50 segments are re-uploaded as one large 500 MiB segment. This doubles the amount of data that Redpanda uploads to object storage, but it also reduces the memory footprint of the partition, which results in better scalability because 98% less memory is needed to keep information about the uploaded segment.

NOTE: Adjacent segment merging doesn't work for compacted topics, because compacted segments are reuploaded after they're compacted. The results are the same.

== Archived metadata

As data in object storage grows, the metadata for it grows. To support efficient long-term data retention, Redpanda splits the metadata in object storage, maintaining metadata of only recently-updated segments in memory or local disk, while safely archiving the remaining metadata in object storage and caching it locally on disk. Archived metadata is then loaded only when historical data is accessed. This allows Tiered Storage to handle partitions of virtually any size or retention length.

Metadata archive storage is configurable. The `cloud_storage_target_manifest_size_bytes` property sets the target size (in bytes) of the metadata archive in object storage. To access data in the archive, Redpanda uses a `ListObjectsV2` API request to fetch a list of external manifests, which are used to access individual segments.

|===

In addition, you might want to change the following node property for each broker:

|===
| Property | Description

| config_ref:cloud_storage_cache_directory,true,node-properties[]
| The directory for the Tiered Storage cache. You must specify the full path. Default is: `<redpanda-data-directory>/cloud_storage_cache.`
|===

You may want to configure the following properties:

|===
| Property | Description

| config_ref:cloud_storage_max_connections,true,cluster-properties[]
| The maximum number of connections to object storage on a broker for each CPU. Remote read and remote write share the same pool of connections. This means that if a connection is used to upload a segment, it cannot be used to download another segment. If this value is too small, some workloads might starve for connections, which results in delayed uploads and downloads. If this value is too large, Redpanda tries to upload a lot of files at the same time and might overwhelm the system. Default is 20.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_initial_backoff_ms,true,tunable-properties[]
| The time, in milliseconds, for an initial backoff interval in the exponential backoff algorithm to handle an error. Default is 100 ms.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_segment_upload_timeout_ms,true,tunable-properties[]
| Timeout for segment upload. Redpanda retries the upload after the timeout. Default is 30000 ms.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_manifest_upload_timeout_ms,true,tunable-properties[]
| Timeout for manifest upload. Redpanda retries the upload after the timeout. Default is 10000 ms.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_max_connection_idle_time_ms,true,tunable-properties[]
| The maximum idle time for persistent HTTP connections. Differs depending on the object storage provider. Default is 5000 ms, which is sufficient for most providers.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_segment_max_upload_interval_sec,true,tunable-properties[]
| Sets the number of seconds for idle timeout. If this property is empty, Redpanda uploads metadata to the object storage, but the segment is not uploaded until it reaches the `segment.bytes` size. By default, the property is empty.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_cache_check_interval,true,tunable-properties[]
| The time, in milliseconds, between cache checks. The size of the cache can grow quickly, so it's important to have a small interval between checks, but if the checks are too frequent, they consume a lot of resources. Default is 30000 ms.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_idle_timeout_ms,true,tunable-properties[]
| The width of the sliding window for the moving average algorithm that calculates object storage utilization. Default is 10 seconds.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_idle_threshold_rps,true,tunable-properties[]
| The utilization threshold for object storage housekeeping. Object storage is considered idle if, during the last 10 seconds, there were 10 or less object storage API requests. Default is 1 request per second.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_enable_segment_merging,true,tunable-properties[]
| Enables adjacent segment merging on all segments in object storage that are smaller than the threshold. Two properties control this behavior: config_ref:cloud_storage_segment_size_target,true,tunable-properties[] and config_ref:cloud_storage_segment_size_min,true,tunable-properties[]. Default is enabled.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_segment_size_target,true,tunable-properties[]
| The desired segment size in object storage. The default segment size is controlled by config_ref:log_segment_size,true,cluster-properties[] and the `segment.bytes` topic configuration property. This property can be set to a value larger than this default segment size, but because that triggers a lot of segment reuploads, it's not recommended.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_segment_size_min,true,tunable-properties[]
| The smallest segment size in object storage that Redpanda keeps. Default is 50% of log segment size.
|===

Under normal circumstances, you should not need to configure the following tunable properties:

|===
| Property | Description

| config_ref:cloud_storage_upload_ctrl_update_interval_ms,true,tunable-properties[]
| The recompute interval for the upload controller. Default is 60000 ms.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_upload_ctrl_p_coeff,true,tunable-properties[]
| The proportional coefficient for the upload controller. Default is -2.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_upload_ctrl_d_coeff,true,tunable-properties[]
| The derivative coefficient for the upload controller. Default is 0.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_upload_ctrl_min_shares,true,tunable-properties[]
| The minimum number of I/O and CPU shares that the remote write process can use. Default is 100.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_upload_ctrl_max_shares,true,tunable-properties[]
| The maximum number of I/O and CPU shares that the remote write process can use. Default is 1000.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_disable_tls,true,cluster-properties[]
| Disables TLS encryption. Set to true if TLS termination is done by the proxy, such as HAProxy. Default is false.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_api_endpoint_port,true,cluster-properties[]
| Overrides the default API endpoint port. Default is 443.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_trust_file,true,cluster-properties[]
| The public certificate used to validate the TLS connection to object storage. If this is empty, Redpanda uses your operating system's CA cert pool.

| config_ref:cloud_storage_reconciliation_interval_ms,true,tunable-properties[]
| Deprecated.

The interval, in milliseconds, to reconcile partitions that need to be uploaded. A long reconciliation interval can result in a delayed reaction to topic creation, topic deletion, or leadership rebalancing events. A short reconciliation interval guarantees that new partitions are picked up quickly, but the process uses more resources. Default is 10000 ms.
