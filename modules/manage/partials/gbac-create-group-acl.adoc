To create an ACL for an OIDC group in {ui}:

. From *Security* on the left navigation menu, select the *Roles* tab.

. Click *Create role* to open the role creation form, or select an existing role and click *Edit*.

. In the *Principals* field, enter the group principal using the `Group:<name>` format. For example, `Group:engineering`.

. Define the permissions (ACLs) you want to grant to users in the group. You can configure ACLs for clusters, topics, consumer groups, transactional IDs, Schema Registry subjects, and Schema Registry operations.

. Click *Create* (or *Update* if editing an existing role).

NOTE: {ui} assigns ACLs through roles. To grant permissions to a group, create a role for that group, add the group as a principal, and define the ACLs on the role. To create ACLs with a `Group:` principal directly (without creating a role), use `rpk` or the Admin API instead.
