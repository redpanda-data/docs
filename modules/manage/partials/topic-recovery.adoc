When you create a topic, you can use remote recovery to download the topic data from object storage. This is useful when you need to restore a single topic in xref:manage:tiered-storage.adoc[Tiered Storage] that was accidentally deleted from a cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Remote recovery is only safe when no other clusters are writing to the specified bucket or container.
* You must enable `redpanda.remote.read` when using remote recovery.
* If you later disable `redpanda.remote.read` on the remote recovery topic, previously hydrated (downloaded) data will not be used to serve requests.
====

To create a new topic using remote recovery (the recovered topic can read and write in the cloud):

[,bash]
----
rpk topic create <topic_name> -c redpanda.remote.recovery=true -c redpanda.remote.write=true -c redpanda.remote.read=true
----

To create a new topic using remote recovery (while also disabling the `redpanda.remote.write` property):

[,bash]
----
rpk topic create <topic_name> -c redpanda.remote.recovery=true -c redpanda.remote.write=false -c redpanda.remote.read=true
----
