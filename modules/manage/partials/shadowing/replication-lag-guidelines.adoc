* **Acceptable lag examples**: 0-1000 messages for low-throughput topics, 0-10000 messages for high-throughput topics
* **Concerning lag examples**: Growing lag over 50,000 messages, or lag that continuously increases without recovering
* **Critical lag examples**: Lag exceeding your data loss tolerance (for example, if you can only afford to lose 1 minute of data, lag should represent less than 1 minute of typical message volume)
