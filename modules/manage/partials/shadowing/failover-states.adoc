== Failover states

=== Shadow link states

The shadow link itself has a simple state model:

* **`ACTIVE`**: Shadow link is operating normally, replicating data
* **`PAUSED`**: Shadow link replication is temporarily halted by user action

Shadow links do not have dedicated failover states. Instead, the link's operational status is determined by the collective state of its shadow topics.

=== Shadow topic states

Individual shadow topics progress through specific states during failover:

* **`ACTIVE`**: Normal replication state before failover
* **`FAULTED`**: Shadow topic has encountered an error and is not replicating
* **`FAILING_OVER`**: Failover initiated, replication stopping
* **`FAILED_OVER`**: Failover completed successfully, topic fully writable
* **`PAUSED`**: Replication temporarily halted by user action
