== Metrics

Shadowing provides comprehensive metrics to track replication performance and health with the xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc[`public_metrics`] endpoint.

|Metric |Type |Description

|`redpanda_shadow_link_shadow_lag`
|Gauge
|The lag of the shadow partition against the source partition, calculated as source partition LSO (Last Stable Offset) minus shadow partition HWM (High Watermark). Monitor by `shadow_link_name`, `topic`, and `partition` to understand replication lag for each partition.

|`redpanda_shadow_link_total_bytes_fetched`
|Count
|The total number of bytes fetched by a sharded replicator (bytes received by the client). Labeled by `shadow_link_name` and `shard` to track data transfer volume from the source cluster.

|`redpanda_shadow_link_total_bytes_written`
|Count
|The total number of bytes written by a sharded replicator (bytes written to the write_at_offset_stm). Uses `shadow_link_name` and `shard` labels to monitor data written to the shadow cluster.

|`redpanda_shadow_link_client_errors`
|Count
|The number of errors seen by the client. Track by `shadow_link_name` and `shard` to identify connection or protocol issues between clusters.

|`redpanda_shadow_link_shadow_topic_state`
|Gauge
|Number of shadow topics in the respective states. Labeled by `shadow_link_name` and `state` to monitor topic state distribution across your shadow links.

|`redpanda_shadow_link_total_records_fetched`
|Count
|The total number of records fetched by the sharded replicator (records received by the client). Monitor by `shadow_link_name` and `shard` to track message throughput from the source.

|`redpanda_shadow_link_total_records_written`
|Count
|The total number of records written by a sharded replicator (records written to the write_at_offset_stm). Uses `shadow_link_name` and `shard` labels to monitor message throughput to the shadow cluster.
