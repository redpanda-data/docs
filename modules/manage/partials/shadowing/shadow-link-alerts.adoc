=== Alert conditions

Configure monitoring alerts for the following conditions, which indicate problems with Shadowing:

* **High replication lag**: When `redpanda_shadow_link_shadow_lag` exceeds your RPO requirements
* **Connection errors**: When `redpanda_shadow_link_client_errors` increases rapidly
* **Topic state changes**: When topics move to `FAULTED` state
* **Task failures**: When replication tasks enter `FAULTED` or `NOT_RUNNING` states
* **Throughput drops**: When bytes/records fetched drops significantly
* **Link unavailability**: When tasks show `LINK_UNAVAILABLE` indicating source cluster connectivity issues
