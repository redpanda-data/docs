== Next steps

After successful failover, focus on recovery planning and process improvement. Begin by assessing the source cluster failure and determining whether to restore the original cluster or permanently promote the shadow cluster as your new primary.

**Immediate recovery planning:**

1. **Assess source cluster**: Determine root cause of the outage
2. **Plan recovery**: Decide whether to restore source cluster or promote shadow cluster permanently
3. **Data synchronization**: Plan how to synchronize any data produced during failover
4. **Fail forward**: Create a new shadow link with the failed over shadow cluster as source to maintain a DR cluster

**Process improvement:**

1. **Document the incident**: Record timeline, impact, and lessons learned
2. **Update runbooks**: Improve procedures based on what you learned
3. **Test regularly**: Schedule regular disaster recovery drills
4. **Review monitoring**: Ensure monitoring caught the issue appropriately
