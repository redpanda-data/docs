**Examples that require full failover:**

* Primary cluster is completely unreachable (network partition, regional outage)
* Multiple broker failures preventing writes to critical topics
* Data center failure affecting majority of brokers
* Persistent authentication or authorization failures across the cluster

**Examples that may NOT require failover:**

* Single broker failure with sufficient replicas remaining
* Temporary network connectivity issues affecting some clients
* High latency or performance degradation (but cluster still functional)
* Non-critical topic or partition unavailability
