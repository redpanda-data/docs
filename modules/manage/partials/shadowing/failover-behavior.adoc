== Failover behavior

When you initiate failover, Redpanda performs the following operations:

1. **Stops replication**: Halts all data fetching from the source cluster for the specified topics or entire shadow link
2. **Failover topics**: Converts read-only shadow topics into regular, writable topics
3. **Updates topic state**: Changes topic status from `ACTIVE` to `FAILING_OVER`, then `FAILED_OVER`

Topic failover is irreversible. Once failed over, topics cannot return to shadow mode, and automatic fallback to the original source cluster is not supported.

NOTE: To avoid a split-brain scenario after failover, ensure that all clients are reconfigured to point to the shadow cluster before resuming write activity.
