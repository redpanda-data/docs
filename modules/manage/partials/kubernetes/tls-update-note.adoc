When you change one of the `tls.enabled` settings for brokers in an existing Redpanda cluster, the Redpanda Operator does not apply the change automatically. To apply the change, you must delete all the Pods that run Redpanda.

[,bash]
----
kubectl delete pod -l app=redpanda --namespace <namespace> --force
