Enabling or disabling TLS for the RPC listener requires you to delete all Pods that run Redpanda. When you change the `rpc.tls.enabled` setting, or if it is not overridden and you change the global `tls.enabled` option, Redpanda cannot safely apply the change because RPC listener configurations must be the same across all brokers. To apply the change, all Redpanda Pods must be deleted simultaneously so that they all start with the updated RPC listener. This action results in temporary downtime of the cluster.

Although you can use the `--force` option to speed up the rollout, it may result in data loss as Redpanda will not be given time to shut down gracefully.

kubectl delete pod -l app=redpanda --namespace <namespace>
