= Configure mTLS

Mutual TLS (mTLS), is an enhanced security protocol that extends the standard TLS encryption protocol. While standard TLS involves a server presenting a certificate to the client to prove its identity, mTLS adds an additional layer of security by requiring the client to also present a certificate to the server.

To enable mTLS, set the `requireClientAuth` setting for a listener to `true`.

For example, for the Kafka API:

[source,yaml,lines=6+8]
----
listeners:
  kafka:
    enabled: true
    port: 9093
    tls:
      enabled: true
      cert: default
      requireClientAuth: true
----

When you enable mTLS, the Helm chart generates a TLS Secret called `redpanda-client` that contains the client's `tls.crt` and `tls.key` files.
