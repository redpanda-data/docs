You can monitor the health of Kafka Connect with
metrics that are exported through a Prometheus endpoint at the default port 9404. You can use Grafana to visualize the metrics and set up alerts.

include::shared:partial$community-supported-connectors.adoc[]

== Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster with `kubectl` installed at least version {supported-kubernetes-version}.
+
To check if you have `kubectl` installed:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl version --client
----

- https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm^] installed with at least version {supported-helm-version}.
+
To check if you have Helm installed:
+
[,bash]
----
helm version
----

- xref:deploy:kafka-connect/k-deploy-kafka-connect.adoc[Kafka Connect deployed] with monitoring enabled.

ifndef::env-kubernetes[]
You can monitor the health of your Redpanda managed connectors with
metrics that Redpanda exports through a Prometheus HTTPS endpoint. You
can use Grafana to visualize the metrics and set up alerts.

The most important metrics to be monitored by alerts are:

* connector failed tasks
* connector lag / connector lag rate

== View connector logs

Connector logs are written to the system topic `__redpanda.connectors_logs`. You can view logs in {ui}, or you can download logs with `rpk`:

[,bash]
----
# Last 100 messages (most recent)
rpk topic consume __redpanda.connectors_logs -o -100 -n 100

# Last 10 minutes
rpk topic consume __redpanda.connectors_logs -o @-10m:end

# Stream new logs only (like tail -f)
rpk topic consume __redpanda.connectors_logs -o end

# Quick filter by connector name, as it appears in {ui}} (JSON logs)
rpk topic consume __redpanda.connectors_logs -o @-10m:end -O json \
  | jq -r 'select(.message | test("<connector-name>"; "i"))'

----

NOTE: Access to system topics may be restricted by organization/project roles. Log retention follows cluster/system-topic policies and messages may expire.


endif::[]

== Limitations

The connectors dashboard renders metrics that are exported by managed
connectors. However, when a connector does not create a task (for
example, an empty topic list), the dashboard will not show metrics for
that connector.

ifdef::env-kubernetes[]

== Verify monitoring is enabled

Before configuring Prometheus, verify that Kafka Connect is exposing metrics:

. Check that the connectors service exposes port 9404:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl get service --namespace <namespace> <release-name>-connectors
----
+
Expected output should include `9404/TCP`:
+
[,bash,.no-copy]
----
NAME                  TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
redpanda-connectors   ClusterIP   10.96.78.129    <none>        8083/TCP,9404/TCP   1h
----

. Test that metrics are being exported:
+
[,bash]
----
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=connectors --namespace <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec $POD_NAME --namespace <namespace> -- curl -s localhost:9404/metrics | head -10
----
+
Expected output should show Prometheus metrics:
+
[,bash,.no-copy]
----
# HELP jmx_exporter_build_info A metric with a constant '1' value labeled with the version of the JMX exporter.
# TYPE jmx_exporter_build_info gauge
jmx_exporter_build_info{version="0.20.0",name="jmx_prometheus_javaagent",} 1.0
# HELP kafka_producer_iotime_total Kafka producer JMX metric type producer
# TYPE kafka_producer_iotime_total gauge
----

== Configure Prometheus

https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus^] is a system monitoring and alerting tool. It collects and stores metrics as time-series data identified by a metric name and key/value pairs.

ifdef::env-kubernetes[]

To configure Prometheus to monitor Kafka Connect metrics in Kubernetes, you can use the https://prometheus-operator.dev/[Prometheus Operator^].

The Prometheus Operator provides Kubernetes-native deployment and management of Prometheus and related monitoring components.

. Follow the steps to https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/getting-started/installation/[deploy the Prometheus Operator^].

. Configure the Prometheus resource to target your Pods running Kafka Connect:
+
.`prometheus.yaml`
[,yaml,lines=9+12]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: Prometheus
metadata:
  name: prometheus
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  serviceAccountName: prometheus
  # To select PodMonitors in all namespaces, omit podMonitorNamespaceSelector or set to an empty selector:
  podMonitorNamespaceSelector: {}
  podMonitorSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: connectors
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: 400Mi
  enableAdminAPI: false
----
+
- `podMonitorNamespaceSelector.matchLabels.name`: The namespace where Redpanda is deployed.
- `podMonitorSelector.matchLabels.app.kubernetes.io/name`: Must match the label on your connectors Pods (default is `connectors`).

. Deploy the standalone Kafka Connect chart with monitoring enabled. This will automatically create a PodMonitor resource:
+
[tabs]
====
--values::
+
.`connectors-monitoring.yaml`
[,yaml]
----
monitoring:
  enabled: true
  scrapeInterval: 30s
----
+
```bash
helm upgrade --install redpanda-connectors redpanda/connectors --namespace <namespace> --create-namespace \
--values connectors-monitoring.yaml
```

--set::
+
[,bash,lines=4-5]
----
helm upgrade --install redpanda-connectors redpanda/connectors \
  --namespace <namespace> \
  --create-namespace \
  --set monitoring.enabled=true \
  --set monitoring.scrapeInterval=30s
----

====

. Wait until the connectors deployment is ready:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl --namespace <namespace> rollout status deployment <release-name>-connectors --watch
----

. Verify that the PodMonitor was automatically created:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl get podmonitor --namespace <namespace>
----
+
Expected output:
+
[,bash,.no-copy]
----
NAME                  AGE
redpanda-connectors   30s
----

. Find the Prometheus Service name:
```bash
kubectl get svc -n <namespace> | rg -i 'prometheus.*prometheus' || true
```
. Port-forward using the discovered service name:
+
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/<prometheus-service-name> 9090:9090 --namespace <namespace>
```

. Navigate to http://localhost:9090/targets to verify that the Kafka Connect targets are being scraped.

== Important metrics to monitor

The most important Kafka Connect metrics to monitor with alerts are:

* **Connector task status**: `kafka_connect_connector_status` and `kafka_connect_task_status`
* **Connector task failures**: `kafka_connect_task_error_count`
* **Consumer lag**: `kafka_consumer_lag_max` (for sink connectors)
* **Producer record send rate**: `kafka_producer_record_send_rate` (for source connectors)
* **Error rates**: `kafka_connect_connector_failed_task_count`

=== Example queries

Important Prometheus queries for monitoring:

[,promql]
----
# Failed connector tasks
kafka_connect_connector_failed_task_count > 0

# Connector status (should be "running")
kafka_connect_connector_status{status!="running"}

# High consumer lag
kafka_consumer_lag_max > 1000

# Low throughput for source connectors
rate(kafka_producer_record_send_total[5m]) < 1
----

endif::[]

ifndef::env-kubernetes[]

NOTE: You can get
https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability/tree/main/cloud[Prometheus
and Grafana running locally^], but not for production instances. For
production instances, deploy Prometheus and Grafana as a standalone or
managed service, as described below.

To configure and use Prometheus to monitor Redpanda managed connector
metrics:

. In Redpanda Cloud, go to *Overview* > *How to connect* > *Prometheus*.
Click the Copy icon for *Prometheus YAML* to copy its content into your
clipboard.
. Edit the `prometheus.yml` file in the Prometheus root folder to add
the Redpanda configuration under `scrape_configs`.
+
[,yaml]
----
scrape_configs:
- job_name: redpandaCloud
    static_configs:
    - targets:
        - ...
    metrics_path: /api/cloud/prometheus/public_metrics
    basic_auth:
    username: prometheus
    password: ...
    scheme: https
----

. Save the configuration file, and restart Prometheus to apply changes.
. Observe in Prometheus that metrics from Redpanda endpoints are
scraped.

endif::[]

== Import the Grafana dashboard

You can use https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/[Grafana^] to query,
visualize, and generate alerts for metrics. Redpanda provides a
https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability/blob/main/grafana-dashboards/Connectors.json[Grafana
dashboard for connectors^].

To create and use the Grafana dashboard to gather telemetry for your
managed connectors, import the connectors dashboard JSON file
(`Connectors.json`).

== Managed connector metrics

You can monitor the following metrics for your Redpanda managed
connectors.

=== Connector tasks

Number of tasks for a specific connector, grouped by status:

* `running` - Tasks that are healthy and running.
* `paused` - Tasks that were paused by a user request.
* `failed` - Tasks that failed during execution.

Expect only `running` and `paused` tasks. Create an alert for failed
tasks.

'''''

=== Sink connector lag

The number of records still to be processed by a connector. This metric
is emitted for sink connectors only (`last_offset` -
`current_offset`).

For newly-created connectors, the metric is high until the connector
sinks all historical data.

Expect the lag not to increase over time.

'''''

=== MM2 replication latency

Age of the last record written to the target cluster by the MirrorMaker
2 connector. This metric is emitted for each partition.

For newly-created connectors, the metric is high until the connector
processes all historical data.

Expect the latency to not increase over time.

'''''

=== Count of the records sent to target (by topic)

Count of records sent to the cluster by source connectors for each
topic.

'''''

=== Redpanda consumer latency

The Redpanda consumer fetch latency for sink connectors.

'''''

=== Redpanda producer latency

The Redpanda producer request latency for source connectors.

'''''

=== Bytes in

Bytes per second (throughput) of data from Redpanda to managed
connectors.

'''''

=== Bytes out

Bytes per second (throughput) of data from managed connectors to
Redpanda.

'''''

=== Record error rate

* `record errors` - Total number of record errors seen in connector
tasks.
* `record failures` - Total number of record failures seen in
connector tasks.
* `record skipped` - Total number of records skipped by connector
tasks.

'''''

=== Producer record rate

* `record sent` - Total number of records sent by connector producers.
* `record retry` - Total number of records sent retries by connector
producers.

'''''

=== Producer record error rate

Rate of producer errors when producing records to Redpanda.

== Connectors support

Redpanda monitors the managed connector infrastructure 24/7 to ensure the service is available. The monitoring of individual connectors is expected to be done by the end user. If an incident occurs, Redpanda Support follows an incident response process to quickly mitigate it.

=== Consumer lag

A connector generally performs lower than expected when it is underprovisioned.


Increase the number of `Max Tasks` (`tasks.max`) in the connector configuration for a given number of instances and instance types.

ifdef::env-cloud[]
For more information, see: xref:deploy:kafka-connect/k-deploy-kafka-connect.adoc[Sizing Connectors].
endif::[]

Additional reasons for increasing consumer lag:

* Available memory for the connector is too low.
* Insufficient number of instances. Autoscaling is based on the total running task count for connectors.

==== Sink connector lag rate metric
The sink connector lag rate metric shows the difference between a topic max offset rate and a sink connector committed offsets rate.
When the message rate for the topic is greater than the sink connector consume rate, the lag rate metric is positive.
You should expect the metric to drop below 0 regularly, which means progress is being made and the connector is able to catch up with the produce rate.

Contact https://support.redpanda.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[Redpanda support^] to align connector instances with your needs.

=== Connector in a failed state

If a connector is in a failed state, first check the connector configuration and logs. If a connector fails, it typically occurs immediately after a configuration change.

* Check exception details and stacktrace by clicking *Show Error*.
* Check connector logs in the *Logs* tab.
* Restart the connector by clicking *Restart*.

The following table lists the most frequent connector configuration issues that cause a failed status:

|===
| Issue | Action

| External system connectivity issue
a|
* Check that the external system is up and running.
* Check that the external system is available.
* Check the connector configuration to confirm that external system properties are correct (URL, table name, bucket name).

| External system authentication issue
a|
* Check that the given account exists in an external system.
* Check the credentials defined in the connector configuration.

| Incorrect topic name or topic name pattern
a|
* Check that the expected topic is created.
* Check that the given topic name pattern matches at least one topic name.

| Out Of Memory error
a|
* Change the connector configuration, lower the connector cache buffer size, and decrease the maximum records allowed in a batch.
* Limit the number of topics set in `Topics to export` (`topics`) or `Topics regex` (`topics.regex`) properties.
* Decrease `Max Tasks` (`tasks.max`) in the connector configuration.
* Contact https://support.redpanda.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[Redpanda support^].
