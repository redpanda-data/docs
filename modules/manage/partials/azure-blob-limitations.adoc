NOTE: Starting in release 23.2.8, Redpanda supports storage accounts that have https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-namespace[hierarchical namespaces^] enabled. For hierarchical namespaces created with a custom endpoint, set `cloud_storage_azure_adls_endpoint` and `cloud_storage_azure_adls_port`. If you haven't configured custom endpoints in Azure, there's no need to edit these properties.
