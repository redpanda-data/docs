== OIDC limitations

* `rpk` does not support OIDC login yet.
* Redpanda Console uses `sub` by default unless overridden.
* Assigning roles to OIDC principals is only supported through `rpk`. Redpanda Console does not yet support assigning roles to OIDC principals.
* Access to the Admin API is only possible if the OIDC principal is set as a
superuser in your Redpanda configuration. Redpanda does not yet support granular
authorization enforcement for the Admin API.
* Data transforms can only be deployed using SASL/SCRAM users because `rpk` does not yet
support using the `SASL/OAUTHBEARER` mechanism.
