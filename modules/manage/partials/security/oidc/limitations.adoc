== OIDC limitations

- Redpanda requires JWT-formatted access tokens (not ID tokens) for Kafka API authentication using SASL/OAUTHBEARER. Access tokens issued by some IdPs, such as Google, are opaque and not supported.

- The `rpk` CLI does not support OIDC login.

- Redpanda Console cannot assign roles to OIDC principals. Roles must be assigned through `rpk`.

- Redpanda requires OIDC principals to be set as superusers to access the Admin API. Granular authorization is not supported.

- The `rpk` CLI does not support the SASL/OAUTHBEARER mechanism for deploying data transforms. Use SASL/SCRAM instead.
