As applications change and their schemas evolve, you may find that producer schemas and consumer schemas are no longer compatible. You decide how you want a consumer to handle data from a producer that uses an older or newer schema.

You can configure different types of schema compatibility, which are applied to a subject when a new schema is registered. The Schema Registry supports the following compatibility types:

- `BACKWARD` (*default*) - Consumers using the new schema (for example, version 10) can read data from producers using the previous schema (for example, version 9).
- `BACKWARD_TRANSITIVE` - Consumers using the new schema (for example, version 10) can read data from producers using all previous schemas (for example, versions 1-9).
- `FORWARD` - Consumers using the previous schema (for example, version 9) can read data from producers using the new schema (for example, version 10).
- `FORWARD_TRANSITIVE` - Consumers using any previous schema (for example, versions 1-9) can read data from producers using the new schema (for example, version 10).
- `FULL` - A new schema and the previous schema (for example, versions 10 and 9) are both backward and forward compatible with each other.
- `FULL_TRANSITIVE` - Each schema is both backward and forward compatible with all registered schemas.
- `NONE` - No schema compatibility checks are done.
