== Configure rack awareness

The instructions in this section are based on a cluster with six brokers and three failure zones. The failure zones, or racks, are identified as A, B, and C, with brokers assigned to them:

[options="header"]
|===
| Broker | Rack
| 1 | A
| 2 | A
| 3 | B
| 4 | B
| 5 | C
| 6 | C
|===


To set up rack awareness for this cluster:

. Open a terminal window and log in to broker 1 on the cluster.
. Run `rpk cluster config edit`.
. In the text editor window that opens, set `enable_rack_awareness` to `true`.
. Save your change and quit the editor.
. Go to the `/etc/redpanda` directory.
. Open the `redpanda.yaml` file for editing.
. In the `redpanda` section, add the `rack` property and set the value to A as shown:
+
[,yaml]
----
rack: "A"
----

. Log in to the remaining brokers and edit their `redpanda.yaml` files. For broker 2, set `rack` to `A`. For brokers 3 and 4, set `rack` to `B`. For brokers 5 and 6, set `rack` to `C`.
. Restart each broker in the cluster for the rack assignments to take effect.

TIP: For high availability, Redpanda recommends adding one or more brokers from each zone to the `seed_servers` configuration.

[NOTE]
====
Redpanda supports uneven rack assignments. For example, you may have four or five brokers to assign across three racks. 

An uneven assignment might cause undesirable effects:

- The local storage in some racks will be more full than in others, which is generally less cost-efficient.
- The compute capacity is also uneven across racks, which could result in uneven latency in some cases.

An equal number of brokers assigned to each rack helps to avoid these scenarios, and is therefore considered optimal.

== Next steps

Use rack awareness with xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/continuous-data-balancing.adoc[Continuous Data Balancing] to continually maintain the configured replication level, even after a rack failure. For a given partition, Redpanda tries to move excess replicas from racks that have more than one replica to racks that have no replicas.
