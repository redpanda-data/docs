= Manage Pod Resources in Kubernetes
:description: Configure your Pod resources such as memory, CPU, and storage.
:tags: ["Kubernetes", "Helm configuration"]

You can define requirements for Pod resources such as CPU, memory, and storage. Redpanda Data recommends that you determine and set these values before deploying the cluster, but you can also update the values on a running cluster.

NOTE: In a running Redpanda cluster, you cannot decrease the number of CPU cores. You can only increase the number of CPU cores.

To see the available resources on the worker nodes that you have provisioned:

[,bash]
----
kubectl describe nodes
----

== Prerequisites

See xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/kubernetes/kubernetes-cluster-requirements.adoc[] for memory, CPU, and storage.

Make sure that your physical or virtual machines have enough resources to give to Redpanda. You assign resources to each Redpanda broker using the `values.yaml` settings. If you need to replace a worker node with one that has more resources, xref:./decommission-brokers.adoc[decommission the brokers] before you replace the worker nodes.

== Configure CPU resources

By default, Redpanda pins its threads to all cores that you allocate to it. The more cores that are allocate to Redpanda, the more throughput it can support. You can configure the CPU resources allocated to each Redpanda broker by overriding the default values. For a description of CPU resource units, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-cpu[Kubernetes documentation^].

For production clusters, you should never set `resources.cpu.cores` to anything less than full cores.

IMPORTANT: You cannot decrease the number of CPU cores in a running cluster.

[TIP]
====
If you're experimenting with Redpanda in Kubernetes, you can set the number of CPU cores to millicores, which represent fractions of CPU time.

=== Disable pinning in shared environments

By default, Redpanda pins its threads to all cores that you allocate to it.
On a dedicated worker node, CPU pinning allows maximum throughput, but in a development environment, where you may run other Pods on the same worker node as Redpanda, CPU pinning can cause your processes to run slower than usual. In these shared environments, you can tell Redpanda not to pin its threads or memory, and reduce the amount of polling it does to a minimum.

NOTE: In production environments, you must run Redpanda brokers on dedicated worker nodes. See xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/kubernetes/kubernetes-cluster-requirements.adoc[Kubernetes Cluster Requirements].

== Configure memory resources

On a worker node, Kubernetes and Redpanda processes are running at the same time, including the Seastar subsystem that is built into the Redpanda binary. Each of these processes consumes memory. You can configure the memory resources that are allocated to these processes.

By default, the Helm chart allocates 80% of the configured memory to Redpanda, leaving the rest for the Seastar subsystem and other container processes. Redpanda recommends this default setting.

NOTE: Although you can also allocate the exact amount of memory for Redpanda and the Seastar subsystem manually, Redpanda does not recommend this approach because setting the wrong values can lead to performance issues, instability, or data loss. As a result, this approach is not documented here.

Redpanda supports the following memory resource units: B, K, M, G, Ki, Mi, and Gi. Memory units are converted to the nearest whole MiB. For a description of memory resource units, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-memory[Kubernetes documentation^].

Setting the `min` and `max` configurations to the same values ensures that Kubernetes assigns a `Guaranteed` Quality of Service (QoS) class to your Pods. Kubernetes uses QoS classes to decide which Pods to evict from a node that runs out of resources. When a node runs out of resources, Kubernetes evicts Pods with a `Guaranteed` QoS last. For more details about QoS, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/#create-a-pod-that-gets-assigned-a-qos-class-of-guaranteed[Kubernetes documentation^].

== Configure storage capacity

Make sure to provision enough disk storage for your streaming workloads.

If you use PersistentVolumes, you can set the storage capacity for each volume. For instructions, see xref:manage:kubernetes/storage/configure-storage.adoc[].
