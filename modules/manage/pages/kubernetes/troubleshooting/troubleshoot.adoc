:tags: ["Kubernetes"]

This topic provides guidance on how to diagnose and troubleshoot issues while deploying Redpanda in Kubernetes.

== Prerequisites

Before troubleshooting Redpanda, make sure that Kubernetes isn't the cause of the problem. For information about debugging applications in a Kubernetes cluster, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/[Kubernetes documentation^].

== Collect all debugging data

If you're unsure of what is wrong, you can generate a diagnostics bundle that contains a wide range of data to help debug and diagnose issues with a Redpanda cluster, a broker, or the machines on which the brokers are running.

See xref:./diagnostics-bundle.adoc[Diagnostics Bundles in Kubernetes].

== View Helm chart configuration

To check the values that were set in the Redpanda Helm chart:

[,bash]
----
helm get values redpanda --namespace <namespace> --all
----

== View Redpanda logs

Logs are sent directory to STDOUT for each Pod. Use the command below to view the logs for a Pod:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> --namespace <namespace>
```

To change the log level to `debug`:

[tabs]
======
Helm + Operator::
+
--
.`redpanda-cluster.yaml`
[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.redpanda.com/v1alpha1
kind: Redpanda
metadata:
  name: redpanda
spec:
  chartRef: {}
  clusterSpec:
    logging:
      logLevel: debug
----

```bash
kubectl apply -f redpanda-cluster.yaml --namespace <namespace>
```
--

Helm::
+
--
[tabs]
====
--values::
+
.`logging.yaml`
[,yaml]
----
logging:
  logLevel: debug
----
+
```bash
helm upgrade --install redpanda redpanda/redpanda --namespace <namespace> --create-namespace \
  --values logging.yaml --reuse-values
```

--set::
+
```bash
helm upgrade --install redpanda redpanda/redpanda --namespace <namespace> --create-namespace \
  --set logging.logLevel=debug
```
====
--
======

== View Redpanda Operator logs

[,bash]
----
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=operator -c manager --namespace <namespace>
----

Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace in which you deployed the Redpanda Operator.

== Troubleshoot known issues

This section describes issues you might encounter while deploying Redpanda in Kubernetes and explains how to troubleshoot them.

=== HelmRelease is not ready

If you are using the Redpanda Operator with Helm, you may see the following message while waiting for a Redpanda custom resource to be deployed:

[,bash,role-"no-copy"]
----
NAME       READY   STATUS
redpanda   False   HelmRepository 'redpanda/redpanda-repository' is not ready
redpanda   False   HelmRelease 'redpanda/redpanda' is not ready
----

While the deployment process can sometimes take a few minutes, a prolonged 'not ready' status may indicate an issue. Follow the steps below to investigate:

. Check the status of the HelmRelease:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl describe helmrelease redpanda --namespace <namespace>
----

. Review the Redpanda Operator logs:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=operator -c manager --namespace <namespace>
----

Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace in which you deployed the Redpanda Operator.

=== StatefulSet never rolls out

If the StatefulSet Pods remain in a pending state, they are waiting for resources to become available.

To identify the Pods that are pending, use the following command:

[,bash]
----
kubectl get pod --namespace <namespace>
----

The response includes a list of Pods in the StatefulSet and their status.

To view logs for a specific Pod, use the following command.

[,bash]
----
kubectl logs -f <pod-name>
----

You can use the output to debug your deployment.

=== Unable to mount volume

If you see volume mounting errors in the Pod events or in the Redpanda logs, make sure that each of your Pods has a volume available in which to store data.

* If you're using PersistentVolumes, make sure that you have one PersistentVolume available for each Redpanda broker, and that each one has the storage capacity that's set in `storage.persistentVolume.size`:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl get pv --namespace <namespace>
----

* If you're using StorageClasses with dynamic provisioners (default), make sure they exist:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl get storageclass
----

NOTE: If you're running on EKS, the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/ebs-csi.html[Amazon EBS CSI driver^] is required to allow EKS to create PersistentVolumes.

To learn how to configure different storage volumes, see xref:manage:kubernetes/configure-storage.adoc[Configure Storage].

=== Dig not defined

This error means that you are using an unsupported version of https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm^]:

[.no-copy]
----
Error: parse error at (redpanda/templates/statefulset.yaml:203): function "dig" not defined
----

Make sure that you are using the minimum required version: {supported-helm-version}.

[,bash]
----
helm version
----

=== Repository name already exists

If you see this error, remove the `redpanda` chart repository, then try installing it again.

[,bash]
----
helm repo remove redpanda
helm repo add redpanda https://charts.redpanda.com
helm repo update
----

=== Invalid large response size

This error appears when your cluster is configured to use TLS, but you don't specify that you are connecting over TLS.

[.no-copy]
----
unable to request metadata: invalid large response size 352518912 > limit 104857600; the first three bytes received appear to be a tls alert record for TLS v1.2; is this a plaintext connection speaking to a tls endpoint?
----

If you're using rpk, make sure to add the `--tls-enabled` flag, and any other necessary TLS flags such as the TLS certificate:

[,bash]
----
kubectl exec <pod-name> -c redpanda --namespace <namepsace> -- rpk cluster info -X brokers=<subdomain>.<domain>:<external-port> --tls-enabled
----

For all available flags, see the xref:reference:rpk/index.adoc[rpk command reference].

=== I/O timeout

This error appears when your worker nodes are unreachable through the given address.

Check the following:

* The address and port are correct.
* Your DNS records point to addresses that resolve to your worker nodes.

=== Is SASL missing?

This error appears when you try to interact with a cluster that has SASL enabled without passing a user's credentials.

[.no-copy]
----
unable to request metadata: broker closed the connection immediately after a request was issued, which happens when SASL is required but not provided: is SASL missing?
----

If you're using rpk, make sure to specify the `--username`, `--password`, and `--sasl-mechanism` flags.

For all available flags, see the xref:reference:rpk/index.adoc[rpk command reference].

=== Malformed HTTP response

This error appears when a cluster has TLS enabled, and you try to access the admin API without passing the required TLS parameters.

[.no-copy]
----
Retrying POST for error: Post "http://127.0.0.1:9644/v1/security/users": net/http: HTTP/1.x transport connection broken: malformed HTTP response "\x15\x03\x03\x00\x02\x02"
----

If you're using rpk, make sure to include the TLS flags.

For all available flags, see the xref:reference:rpk/index.adoc[rpk command reference].

=== Fatal error during checker "Data directory is writable" execution

This error appears when Redpanda does not have write access to your configured storage volume under `storage` in the Helm chart.

[.no-copy]
----
Error: fatal error during checker "Data directory is writable" execution: open /var/lib/redpanda/data/test_file: permission denied
----

To fix this error, set `statefulset.initContainers.setDataDirOwnership.enabled` to `true` so that the initContainer can set the correct permissions on the data directories.

=== Cannot patch "redpanda" with kind StatefulSet

This error appears when you run `helm upgrade` with the `--values` flag but do not include all your previous overrides.

[.no-copy]
----
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: cannot patch "redpanda" with kind StatefulSet: StatefulSet.apps "redpanda" is invalid: spec: Forbidden: updates to statefulset spec for fields other than 'replicas', 'template', 'updateStrategy', 'persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy' and 'minReadySeconds' are forbidden
----

Make sure to do one of the following:

* Include all the value overrides from the previous installation or upgrade using either the `--set` or the `--values` flags.
* Use the `--reuse-values` flag.
+
WARNING: Do not use the `--reuse-values` flag to upgrade from one version of the Helm chart to another. This flag stops Helm from using any new values in the upgraded chart.

=== Cannot patch "redpanda-console" with kind Deployment

This error appears if you try to upgrade your deployment and you already have `console.enabled` set to `true`.

[.no-copy]
----
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: cannot patch "redpanda-console" with kind Deployment: Deployment.apps "redpanda-console" is invalid: spec.selector: Invalid value: v1.LabelSelector{MatchLabels:map[string]string{"app.kubernetes.io/instance":"redpanda", "app.kubernetes.io/name":"console"}, MatchExpressions:[]v1.LabelSelectorRequirement(nil)}: field is immutable
----

To fix this error, set `console.enabled` to `false` so that Helm doesn't try to deploy Redpanda Console again.
