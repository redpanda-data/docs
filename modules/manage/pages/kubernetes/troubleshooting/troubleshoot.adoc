:description: Find advice on how to diagnose and troubleshoot issues while deploying Redpanda in Kubernetes.
:tags: ["Kubernetes"]

This topic provides guidance on how to diagnose and troubleshoot issues with Redpanda deployments in Kubernetes.

== Prerequisites

Before troubleshooting Redpanda, make sure that Kubernetes isn't the cause of the issue. For information about debugging applications in a Kubernetes cluster, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/[Kubernetes documentation^].

== Collect all debugging data

If you're unsure of what is wrong, you can generate a diagnostics bundle that contains a wide range of data to help debug and diagnose a Redpanda cluster or the nodes on which the brokers are running.

See xref:./diagnostics-bundle.adoc[Diagnostics Bundles in Kubernetes].

== View Helm chart configuration

To check the overrides that were applied to your deployment:

[,bash]
----
helm get values <chart-name> --namespace <namespace>
----

If you're using the Redpanda Operator, the chart name matches the name of your Redpanda resource.

To check all the values that were set in the Redpanda Helm chart, including any overrides:

[,bash]
----
helm get values <chart-name> --namespace <namespace> --all
----

== View Redpanda logs

Logs for each Redpanda broker running inside a Pod are sent to STDOUT. Use `kubectl logs` to get logs from STDOUT.

To view logs for a particular Pod:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> --namespace <namespace>
```

To view logs for all Pods in the StatefulSet:

```bash
kubectl logs --namespace <namespace> -l app.kubernetes.io/component=redpanda-statefulset
```

To change the log level of the Redpanda brokers to `debug`:

[tabs]
======
Helm + Operator::
+
--
.`redpanda-cluster.yaml`
[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.redpanda.com/v1alpha1
kind: Redpanda
metadata:
  name: redpanda
spec:
  chartRef: {}
  clusterSpec:
    logging:
      logLevel: debug
----

```bash
kubectl apply -f redpanda-cluster.yaml --namespace <namespace>
```
--

Helm::
+
--
[tabs]
====
--values::
+
.`logging.yaml`
[,yaml]
----
logging:
  logLevel: debug
----
+
```bash
helm upgrade --install redpanda redpanda/redpanda --namespace <namespace> --create-namespace \
  --values logging.yaml --reuse-values
```

--set::
+
```bash
helm upgrade --install redpanda redpanda/redpanda --namespace <namespace> --create-namespace \
  --set logging.logLevel=debug
```
====
--
======

== View Redpanda Operator logs

To learn what's happening with the Redpanda Operator and the associated Redpanda resources, you can inspect a combination of Kubernetes events and the resource manifests. By monitoring these events and resources, you can troubleshoot any issues that arise during the lifecycle of a Redpanda deployment.

[,bash]
----
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=operator -c manager --namespace <namespace>
----

=== View recent events

To understand the latest events that occurred in your Redpanda cluster's namespace, you can sort events by their creation timestamp:

[,bash]
----
kubectl get events --namespace <namespace> --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'
----

=== Inspect Helm releases

The Redpanda Operator uses Flux to deploy the Redpanda Helm chart. By inspecting the `helmreleases.helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io` resource, you can get detailed information about the Helm installation process for your Redpanda resource:

[,bash]
----
kubectl get helmreleases.helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io -o yaml <redpanda-resource-name> --namespace <namespace>
----

To check the Redpanda resource:

[,bash]
----
kubectl get redpandas.cluster.redpanda.com -o yaml --namespace <namespace>
----

In both the HelmRelease and the Redpanda resource, the condition section reveals the ongoing status of the Helm installation. These conditions provide information on the success, failure, or pending status of various operations.

== Troubleshoot known issues

This section describes issues you might encounter while deploying Redpanda in Kubernetes and explains how to troubleshoot them.

=== HelmRelease is not ready

If you are using the Redpanda Operator with Helm, you may see the following message while waiting for a Redpanda custom resource to be deployed:

[,bash,role-"no-copy"]
----
NAME       READY   STATUS
redpanda   False   HelmRepository 'redpanda/redpanda-repository' is not ready
redpanda   False   HelmRelease 'redpanda/redpanda' is not ready
----

While the deployment process can sometimes take a few minutes, a prolonged 'not ready' status may indicate an issue. Follow the steps below to investigate:

. Check the status of the HelmRelease:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl describe helmrelease <redpanda-resource-name> --namespace <namespace>
----

. Review the Redpanda Operator logs:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=operator -c manager --namespace <namespace>
----

=== StatefulSet never rolls out

If the StatefulSet Pods remain in a pending state, they are waiting for resources to become available.

To identify the Pods that are pending, use the following command:

[,bash]
----
kubectl get pod --namespace <namespace>
----

The response includes a list of Pods in the StatefulSet and their status.

To view logs for a specific Pod, use the following command.

[,bash]
----
kubectl logs -f <pod-name> --namespace <namespace>
----

You can use the output to debug your deployment.

=== Unable to mount volume

If you see volume mounting errors in the Pod events or in the Redpanda logs, make sure that each of your Pods has a volume available in which to store data.

* If you're using PersistentVolumes, make sure that you have one PersistentVolume available for each Redpanda broker, and that each one has the storage capacity that's set in `storage.persistentVolume.size`:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl get persistentvolume --namespace <namespace>
----

* If you're using StorageClasses with dynamic provisioners (default), make sure they exist:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl get storageclass
----

NOTE: If you're running on EKS, the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/ebs-csi.html[Amazon EBS CSI driver^] is required to allow EKS to create PersistentVolumes.

To learn how to configure different storage volumes, see xref:manage:kubernetes/configure-storage.adoc[Configure Storage].

=== Dig not defined

This error means that you are using an unsupported version of https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm^]:

[.no-copy]
----
Error: parse error at (redpanda/templates/statefulset.yaml:203): function "dig" not defined
----

Make sure that you are using the minimum required version: {supported-helm-version}.

[,bash]
----
helm version
----

=== Repository name already exists

If you see this error, remove the `redpanda` chart repository, then try installing it again.

[,bash]
----
helm repo remove redpanda
helm repo add redpanda https://charts.redpanda.com
helm repo update
----

=== Invalid large response size

This error appears when your cluster is configured to use TLS, but you don't specify that you are connecting over TLS.

[.no-copy]
----
unable to request metadata: invalid large response size 352518912 > limit 104857600; the first three bytes received appear to be a tls alert record for TLS v1.2; is this a plaintext connection speaking to a tls endpoint?
----

If you're using rpk, make sure to add the `--tls-enabled` flag, and any other necessary TLS flags such as the TLS certificate:

[,bash]
----
kubectl exec <pod-name> -c redpanda --namespace <namepsace> -- rpk cluster info -X brokers=<subdomain>.<domain>:<external-port> -X tls.enabled=true
----

For all available flags, see the xref:reference:rpk/index.adoc[rpk command reference].

=== I/O timeout

This error appears when your worker nodes are unreachable through the given address.

Check the following:

* The address and port are correct.
* Your DNS records point to addresses that resolve to your worker nodes.

=== Is SASL missing?

This error appears when you try to interact with a cluster that has SASL enabled without passing a user's credentials.

[.no-copy]
----
unable to request metadata: broker closed the connection immediately after a request was issued, which happens when SASL is required but not provided: is SASL missing?
----

If you're using rpk, make sure to specify the `-X user`, `-X pass`, and `-X sasl.mechanism` flags.

For all available flags, see the xref:reference:rpk/index.adoc[rpk command reference].

=== Malformed HTTP response

This error appears when a cluster has TLS enabled, and you try to access the admin API without passing the required TLS parameters.

[.no-copy]
----
Retrying POST for error: Post "http://127.0.0.1:9644/v1/security/users": net/http: HTTP/1.x transport connection broken: malformed HTTP response "\x15\x03\x03\x00\x02\x02"
----

If you're using rpk, make sure to include the TLS flags.

For all available flags, see the xref:reference:rpk/index.adoc[rpk command reference].

=== Fatal error during checker "Data directory is writable" execution

This error appears when Redpanda does not have write access to your configured storage volume under `storage` in the Helm chart.

[.no-copy]
----
Error: fatal error during checker "Data directory is writable" execution: open /var/lib/redpanda/data/test_file: permission denied
----

To fix this error, set `statefulset.initContainers.setDataDirOwnership.enabled` to `true` so that the initContainer can set the correct permissions on the data directories.

=== Cannot patch "redpanda" with kind StatefulSet

This error appears when you run `helm upgrade` with the `--values` flag but do not include all your previous overrides.

[.no-copy]
----
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: cannot patch "redpanda" with kind StatefulSet: StatefulSet.apps "redpanda" is invalid: spec: Forbidden: updates to statefulset spec for fields other than 'replicas', 'template', 'updateStrategy', 'persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy' and 'minReadySeconds' are forbidden
----

Make sure to do one of the following:

* Include all the value overrides from the previous installation or upgrade using either the `--set` or the `--values` flags.
* Use the `--reuse-values` flag.
+
WARNING: Do not use the `--reuse-values` flag to upgrade from one version of the Helm chart to another. This flag stops Helm from using any new values in the upgraded chart.

=== Cannot patch "redpanda-console" with kind Deployment

This error appears if you try to upgrade your deployment and you already have `console.enabled` set to `true`.

[.no-copy]
----
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: cannot patch "redpanda-console" with kind Deployment: Deployment.apps "redpanda-console" is invalid: spec.selector: Invalid value: v1.LabelSelector{MatchLabels:map[string]string{"app.kubernetes.io/instance":"redpanda", "app.kubernetes.io/name":"console"}, MatchExpressions:[]v1.LabelSelectorRequirement(nil)}: field is immutable
----

To fix this error, set `console.enabled` to `false` so that Helm doesn't try to deploy Redpanda Console again.
