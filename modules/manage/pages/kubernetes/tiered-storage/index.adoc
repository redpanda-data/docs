With Tiered Storage, your cluster consists of two storage tiers, local and remote (using object storage with a cloud provider). Tiered Storage helps to lower storage costs by offloading log segments to object storage. Tiered Storage also provides simple data archiving that you can use for data recovery.

Tiered Storage enables fast commission and decommission, remote read replicas, single topic recovery, and whole cluster restore, ensuring high availability of your Redpanda cluster.
