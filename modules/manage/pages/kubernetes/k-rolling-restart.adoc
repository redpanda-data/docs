A rolling restart involves restarting one broker at a time while the remaining brokers in your cluster continue running. Rolling restarts help to minimize downtime during a full cluster restart.
You should perform a rolling restart during operations such as configuration updates that require a restart, version upgrades, or cluster maintenance.

== Prerequisites

You must have the following:

* xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/kubernetes/index.adoc[A Redpanda cluster running in Kubernetes].
* The default xref:reference:k-redpanda-helm-spec.adoc#statefulset-updatestrategy-type[RollingUpdate strategy] configured in the Helm values.

== What happens during a rolling restart

When you run Redpanda in Kubernetes, your Redpanda cluster is managed as a StatefulSet where each broker runs inside its own Pod. As a result, you can perform a rolling restart using the Kubernetes API to terminate one Pod at a time, starting from the one with the highest ordinal.

During a rolling restart the xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/kubernetes/k-deployment-overview.adoc[Redpanda Helm chart] automates the following procedure on each broker, using the `preStop` and `postStart` lifecycle hooks:

. The `preStop` hook is executed immediately before a container is terminated.
The `preStop` hook is responsible for the following:
.. Place the broker into maintenance mode.
+
Placing brokers into maintenance mode reduces the risk of interruption or degradation in service. When a broker is placed into maintenance mode, it reassigns its partition leadership to other brokers for all topics that have a replication factor greater than one (three is the default replication factor for topics). Reassigning partition leadership involves _draining_ leadership from the broker and _transferring_ that leadership to another broker.
.. Terminate the Pod.
+
After the `preStop` hook completes its tasks, Kubernetes sends a SIGTERM signal to the container, signaling it to shut down.
+
Maintenance mode may not have finished when the SIGTERM is sent. As a result, Kubernetes waits for the duration of the `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` for Redpanda to shut down gracefully. If it's still executing, a SIGKILL is sent to the container to forcefully terminate Redpanda.
The Pod is then terminated and restarted due to the default rolling update policy of the StatefulSet.
+
[NOTE]
====
The default `terminationGracePeriod` is 90 seconds, which should be long enough for maintenance mode to finish in large clusters.
You can test different values in a development environment.
To configure the `terminationGracePeriod`,
use the xref:reference:k-redpanda-helm-spec.adoc#statefulsetterminationgraceperiodseconds[`statefulset.terminationGracePeriodSeconds`] setting.
====
. The `postStart` hook is executed immediately after a container is created.
The `postStart` hook takes the broker out of maintenance mode. This action re-integrates the broker into the cluster, allowing it to start handling requests and participate in the cluster's operations again.

== Perform a rolling restart

. Check for topics that have a replication factor greater than one.
+
Partitions that live on only one broker will be offline during the restart. If you have topics with a replication factor of 1, and if you have sufficient disk space, temporarily xref:manage:data-migration.adoc#change-topic-replication-factor[increase the replication factor] to limit outages for these topics during the rolling upgrade.

. Ensure that the cluster is healthy:
+
```bash
kubectl exec <pod-name> --namespace <namespace> -c redpanda -- \
  rpk cluster health
```
+
The draining process won't start until the cluster is healthy.

CLUSTER HEALTH OVERVIEW

All nodes:                   [0 1 2] <2>

----
<1> The cluster is either healthy (`true`) or unhealthy (`false`).
<2> The node IDs of all brokers in the cluster.
<3> These fields contain data only when the cluster is unhealthy.

. Trigger a rolling restart of all Pods in the StatefulSet:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl rollout restart statefulset redpanda --namespace=<namespace>
----

. Wait for all Pods to restart:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl rollout status statefulset redpanda --namespace=<namespace> --watch
----

== Verify the cluster's health

To verify that the cluster is running properly, run:

```bash
kubectl exec <pod-name> --namespace <namespace> -c redpanda -- \
  rpk cluster health
```

To view additional information about your brokers, run:

```bash
kubectl exec <pod-name> --namespace <namespace> -c redpanda -- \
  rpk redpanda admin brokers list
```
