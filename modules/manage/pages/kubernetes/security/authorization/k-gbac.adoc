:learning-objective-1: Identify how GBAC applies to Kubernetes-managed Redpanda clusters

[NOTE]
====
Kubernetes-native configuration for group-based access control (GBAC) is currently in development. This page will be updated when support is available.

In the meantime, you can configure GBAC on self-managed deployments using `rpk` or the Admin API. See xref:manage:security/authorization/gbac.adoc[Configure Group-Based Access Control] for the current configuration guide.

== About GBAC

Group-based access control (GBAC) is an enterprise feature that extends OIDC authentication to support group-based permissions. Instead of assigning roles or ACLs to individual users, you assign them to OIDC groups. Users inherit permissions from all the groups they belong to, as reported by their identity provider (IdP) through OIDC token claims.

GBAC works by reading a configurable claim from the OIDC token (for example, `$.groups`) and matching those group names against `Group:<name>` principals in ACLs and role assignments in Redpanda.

For full details on how GBAC works and how to manage groups, roles, and ACLs, see xref:manage:security/authorization/gbac.adoc[Configure Group-Based Access Control].
