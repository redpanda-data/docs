Redpanda clusters can use Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure internal and external communications with clients and other brokers.
In the Redpanda Helm chart, TLS is enabled by default for all internal and external listeners, using self-signed certificates managed by glossterm:cert-manager[^].
You can configure the chart to use your own certificates with or without cert-manager.
