Deleting a PersistentVolume (PV) can be necessary for a variety of reasons, such as removing a broker and its data from the cluster or performing maintenance or upgrades on the PersistentVolume.

== Prerequisites

* A running Redpanda deployment on a Kubernetes cluster.
* PersistentVolumes for either the Redpanda data directory or the Tiered Storage cache.

== Delete a PersistentVolume

To delete a PersistentVolume, follow these steps to ensure that your data is moved to other brokers in the cluster.

. Identify the PV that you want to delete:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl get persistentvolume
----

. xref:manage:kubernetes/k-decommission-brokers.adoc[Decommission the broker] that has a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) bound to the PV.
+
Decommissioning helps prevent data loss by gracefully moving the broker's topic partitions and replicas to other brokers in the cluster.

. Delete the PVC that is bound to your PV:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl delete persistentvolumeclaim <pvc-name> --namespace <namespace>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To prevent accidental loss of data, PersistentVolumesClaims are not deleted when Redpanda brokers are removed from a cluster.
When you no longer need PersistentVolumeClaims, you must delete them manually.
Check the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#reclaim-policy[reclaim policy] of your PersistentVolumes before deleting a PersistentVolumeClaim.

```bash
kubectl get persistentvolume --namespace <namespace>
```
====

. If the `reclaimPolicy` of your PV is not `Delete`, delete the PV:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl delete persistentvolume <pv-name>
----

. Delete the Pod whose PVC was bound to the deleted PV:
+
The StatefulSet schedules a new Pod on the same worker node and assigns it a unique node ID.
+
If you use PVs for the Redpanda data directory, the Pod will have a new PVC bound to a PV that is set in xref:reference:k-redpanda-helm-spec.adoc#storagepersistentvolumestorageclass[`storage.persistentVolume.storageClass`]. See xref:./k-configure-storage.adoc[Use PersistentVolumes].
+
If you use PVs for the Tiered Storage cache, the Pod will have a new PVC bound to a PV that is set in xref:reference:k-redpanda-helm-spec.adoc#storagetieredstoragepersistentvolumestorageclass[`storage.tieredStoragePersistentVolume.storageClass`]. See xref:./tiered-storage.adoc#caching[Tiered Storage Caching].

. Verify that the new Redpanda broker is running and that it has access to the appropriate PersistentVolume.
+
```bash
kubectl --namespace <namespace> exec -ti <pod-name> -c <container-name> -- \
  rpk cluster info
```

You should see your new broker running with a new node ID.
