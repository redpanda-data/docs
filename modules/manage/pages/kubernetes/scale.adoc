= Scale Redpanda in Kubernetes
:description: Scaling a Redpanda cluster involves increasing its resources and/or the number of nodes to handle more data, traffic, and users.

Scaling a Redpanda cluster involves increasing its resources and/or the number of nodes to handle more data, traffic, and users. You can scale a Redpanda cluster both vertically and horizontally, depending on your requirements.

== Vertical Scaling

Vertical (also known as scaling up/down) scaling means increasing the resources, such as CPU cores, memory, and storage, of existing brokers in the cluster.

To scale vertically, see xref:./manage-resources.adoc[Manage Pod Resources in Kubernetes].

IMPORTANT: You cannot decrease the number of CPU cores in a running cluster.

== Horizontal Scaling

Horizontal scaling (also known as scaling out/in) means adding more brokers to the cluster, thereby distributing the load and data across different worker nodes.

. If you're scaling out:
- Ensure that you have one additional worker node for each Redpanda broker that you want to add.
- If you use local PersistentVolumes (PV), ensure that your additional worker nodes have a PV available.

. Update the number of replicas in the Helm chart:

```bash
kubectl get statefulsets --namespace <namespace>
