= Install the PVCUnbinder Sidecar

:description: pass:q[The PVCUnbinder sidecar is an emergency backstop for Redpanda clusters that use PersistentVolumes (PVs) for the Redpanda data directory. When a node running a Redpanda Pod suddenly goes offline, the PVCUnbinder detects the lost node, retains the associated PV, and removes the corresponding PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC). This workflow allows the Redpanda Pod to be rescheduled on a new node without losing critical data.]

[WARNING]
====
The PVCUnbinder sidecar is intended only for emergency scenarios (for example, node hardware or infrastructure failures). *Never use the PVCUnbinder sidecar as a routine method for removing brokers.* If you want to remove brokers, see xref:manage:kubernetes/k-decommission-brokers.adoc[Decommission brokers] for the correct procedure.

== Why use the PVCUnbinder sidecar?

If a worker node hosting a Redpanda Pod suddenly fails or disappears, Kubernetes might leave the associated PV and PVC in an _attached_ or _in-use_ state. Without the PVCUnbinder (or manual intervention), the Redpanda Pod cannot safely reschedule to another node because the volume is still recognized as occupied. Also, the default reclaim policy might delete the volume, risking data loss. The PVCUnbinder sidecar automates the steps needed to retain the volume and remove the stale PVC, so Redpanda Pods can move to healthy nodes without losing the data in the original PV.

== How the PVCUnbinder sidecar works

When the PVCUnbinder detects events that indicate a Node resource is no longer available, it does the following:

- For each Redpanda Pod on that Node, it identifies the PVC (if any) the Pod was using for its storage.
- It sets the reclaim policy of the affected PersistentVolume (PV) to `Retain`.
- It deletes the associated PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) to allow the Redpanda broker Pod to reschedule onto a new, operational node.

== Test the PVCUnbinder sidecar

. Test the PVCUnbinder sidecar by deleting a Node resource:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl delete node <node-name>
----
+
NOTE: This step is for testing purposes only.

. Monitor the logs of the PVCUnbinder sidecar:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl logs <pod-name> --namespace <namespace> -c sidecars
----
+
You should see that the PVCUnbinder successfully deleted the PVC of the Pod that was running on the deleted Node resource.
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl get persistentvolumeclaim --namespace <namespace>
----

. Verify that the reclaim policy of the PV is set to `Retain` to allow you to recover the node, if necessary:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl get persistentvolume --namespace <namespace>
----

After the PVCUnbinder has finished, xref:manage:kubernetes/k-decommission-brokers.adoc[decommission the broker] that was removed from the node. This is necessary to prevent a potential loss of quorum and ensure cluster stability.

NOTE: Make sure to use the `--force` flag when decommissioning the broker with xref:reference:rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-admin-brokers-decommission.adoc[`rpk redpanda admin brokers decommission`]. This flag is required when the broker is no longer running.
