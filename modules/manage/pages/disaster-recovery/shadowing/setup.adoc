== Prerequisites

ifndef::env-cloud[]
[NOTE]
====
include::shared:partial$enterprise-license.adoc[]
====
endif::[]

=== License and cluster requirements

- Both clusters must be running Redpanda v25.3 or later. 
ifndef::env-cloud[]
- If you use Redpanda Console, ensure that it is running v3.30 or later.

- You must have xref:get-started:licensing/overview.adoc[Enterprise Edition] licenses on both clusters. 
endif::[]

[TIP]
====
Deploy clusters in different geographic regions to protect against regional disasters.
====

=== Cluster properties

Both source and shadow clusters must have the xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#enable_shadow_linking[`enable_shadow_linking`] cluster property set to `true`. 

ifdef::env-cloud[]
[NOTE]
====
Starting with Redpanda v25.3, this cluster property is enabled by default on new Redpanda Cloud clusters. Existing clusters created before v25.3 must enable this property manually. See xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/config-cluster.adoc[].
====
endif::[]

ifndef::env-cloud[]
To enable this property, run: 
[,bash]
----
rpk cluster config set enable_shadow_linking true
----

[NOTE]
====
This cluster property must be configured using `rpk` or the Admin API v1 before you can create shadow links through any interface.
====

To learn more about configuring cluster properties, see xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/cluster-property-configuration.adoc[].

=== Administrative access

Superuser access is required on both clusters through xref:get-started:rpk/index.adoc[`rpk`], the Admin API, or xref:console:index.adoc[Redpanda Console] to create and manage shadow links.
endif::[]

=== Replication service permissions

ifdef::env-cloud[]
You must configure a service account on the source cluster with the following xref:security:authorization/acl.adoc[ACL] permissions for shadow link replication:
endif::[]

ifndef::env-cloud[]
You must configure a service account on the source cluster with the following xref:manage:security/authorization/acl.adoc[ACL] permissions for shadow link replication:
endif::[]

* **Topics**: `read` permission on all topics you want to replicate
* **Topic configurations**: `describe_configs` permission on topics for configuration synchronization
* **Consumer groups**: `describe` and `read` permission on consumer groups for offset replication
* **ACLs**: `describe` permission on ACL resources to replicate security policies
* **Cluster**: `describe` permission on the cluster resource to access ACLs

This service account authenticates from the shadow cluster to the source cluster and performs the actual data replication. The credentials for this account are provided when you set up the shadow link.

=== Network and authentication

You must configure network connectivity between clusters with appropriate firewall rules to allow the shadow cluster to connect to the source cluster for data replication. Shadowing uses a pull-based architecture where the shadow cluster fetches data from the source cluster. For detailed networking configuration, see <<networking>>.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
If using xref:manage:security/authentication.adoc[authentication] for the shadow link connection, configure the source cluster with your chosen authentication method (SASL/SCRAM, TLS, mTLS) and ensure the shadow cluster has the proper credentials to authenticate to the source cluster.
endif::[]

ifdef::env-cloud[]
If using xref:security:cloud-authentication.adoc[authentication] for the shadow link connection, configure the source cluster with your chosen authentication method (SASL/SCRAM, TLS, mTLS) and ensure the shadow cluster has the proper credentials to authenticate to the source cluster.
endif::[]

== Set up Shadowing

To set up Shadowing, you need to create a shadow link and configure filters to select which topics, consumer groups, and ACLs to replicate. 

ifdef::env-cloud[]
You can use the Redpanda Cloud UI, `rpk`, or the Data Plane API. 
endif::[]

ifndef::env-cloud[]
You can use Redpanda Console, `rpk`, or the Admin API. 
endif::[]

== Create a shadow link

To create a shadow link with the source cluster using `rpk`, run the following command from the shadow cluster:

[,bash]
----
rpk shadow create --config-file shadow-config.yaml
----

For detailed command options, see xref:reference:rpk/rpk-shadow/rpk-shadow-create.adoc[`rpk shadow create`].

== Set filters

Filters determine which resources Shadowing automatically creates when establishing your shadow link.

Topic filters select which topics Shadowing automatically creates as shadow topics when they appear on the source cluster. After Shadowing creates a shadow topic, it continues replicating until you failover the topic, delete it, or delete the entire shadow link.

Consumer group and ACL filters control which groups and security policies replicate to maintain application functionality.

[TIP]
====
You can use `rpk` to generate a configuration template:

[,bash]
----
# Generate a sample configuration file with placeholder values
rpk shadow config generate -o shadow-config.yaml

# Or generate a template with detailed field documentation
rpk shadow config generate --print-template -o shadow-config-template.yaml
----

This creates a complete YAML configuration file that you can customize for your environment. The template includes all available fields with comments explaining their purpose.
====

=== Filter types and patterns

Each filter uses two key settings:

* **Pattern type**: Determines how names are matched
  - `LITERAL`: Matches names exactly (including the special wildcard `*` to match all items)
  - `PREFIX`: Matches names that start with the specified string
* **Filter type**: Specifies whether to INCLUDE or EXCLUDE matching items
  - `INCLUDE`: Replicate items that match the pattern
  - `EXCLUDE`: Skip items that match the pattern

=== Filter processing rules

Redpanda processes filters in the order you define them with EXCLUDE filters taking precedence. Design your filter lists carefully:

1. **Exclude filters win**: If any EXCLUDE filter matches a resource, it is excluded regardless of INCLUDE filters.
2. **Order matters for INCLUDE filters**: Among INCLUDE filters, the first match determines the result.
3. **Default behavior**: Items that don't match any filter are excluded from replication.

=== Common filtering patterns

Replicate all topics except test topics:
[,yaml]
----
topic_metadata_sync_options:
  auto_create_shadow_topic_filters:
  - pattern_type: PREFIX
    filter_type: EXCLUDE
    name: test-                        # Exclude all test topics
  - pattern_type: LITERAL
    filter_type: INCLUDE
    name: '*'                         # Include all other topics
----

Replicate only production topics:
[,yaml]
----
topic_metadata_sync_options:
  auto_create_shadow_topic_filters:
  - pattern_type: PREFIX
    filter_type: INCLUDE
    name: prod-                       # Include production topics
  - pattern_type: PREFIX
    filter_type: INCLUDE
    name: production-                 # Alternative production prefix
----

Replicate specific consumer groups:
[,yaml]
----
consumer_offset_sync_options:
  group_filters:
  - pattern_type: LITERAL
    filter_type: INCLUDE
    name: critical-app-consumers      # Include specific consumer group
  - pattern_type: PREFIX
    filter_type: INCLUDE
    name: prod-consumer-              # Include production consumers
----

=== Schema Registry synchronization

Shadowing can replicate Schema Registry data by shadowing the `_schemas` system topic. When enabled, this provides byte-for-byte replication of schema definitions, versions, and compatibility settings.

To enable Schema Registry synchronization, add the following to your shadow link configuration:

[,yaml]
----
schema_registry_sync_options:
  shadow_schema_registry_topic: {}
----

**Requirements:**

- The `_schemas` topic must exist on the source cluster
- The `_schemas` topic must not exist on the shadow cluster, or must be empty
- Once enabled, the `_schemas` topic will be replicated completely

**Important:** After the `_schemas` topic becomes a shadow topic, it cannot be stopped without either failing over the topic or deleting it entirely.


=== System topic filtering rules

Redpanda system topics have the following specific filtering restrictions:

* Literal filters for `__consumer_offsets` and `_redpanda.audit_log` are rejected.
* Prefix filters for topics starting with `_redpanda` or `__redpanda` are rejected.  
* Wildcard `*` filters will not match topics that start with `_redpanda` or `__redpanda`.
* To shadow specific system topics, you must provide explicit literal filters for those individual topics.

=== ACL filtering

ACLs are replicated by the xref:manage:disaster-recovery/shadowing/overview.adoc#shadow-link-tasks[Security Migrator task]. This is recommended to ensure that your shadow cluster has the same permissions as your source cluster. To configure ACL filters:

[,yaml]
----
security_sync_options:
  acl_filters:
  # Include read permissions for production topics
  - resource_filter:
      resource_type: TOPIC            # Filter by topic resource
      pattern_type: PREFIXED          # Match by prefix
      name: prod-                     # Production topic prefix
    access_filter:
      principal: User:app-user        # Application service user
      operation: READ                 # Read operation
      permission_type: ALLOW          # Allow permission
      host: '*'                       # Any host
  # Include consumer group permissions
  - resource_filter:
      resource_type: GROUP            # Filter by consumer group
      pattern_type: LITERAL           # Exact match
      name: '*'                       # All consumer groups
    access_filter:
      principal: User:app-user        # Same application user
      operation: READ                 # Read operation
      permission_type: ALLOW          # Allow permission
      host: '*'                       # Any host
----

=== Consumer group filtering and behavior

Consumer group filters determine which consumer groups have their offsets replicated to the shadow cluster by the xref:manage:disaster-recovery/shadowing/overview.adoc#shadow-link-tasks[Consumer Group Shadowing task]. 

Offset replication operates selectively within each consumer group. Only committed offsets for active shadow topics are synchronized, even if the consumer group has offsets for additional topics that aren't being shadowed. For example, if consumer group "app-consumers" has committed offsets for "orders", "payments", and "inventory" topics, but only "orders" is an active shadow topic, then only the "orders" offsets will be replicated to the shadow cluster.

[,yaml]
----
consumer_offset_sync_options:
  interval: 30s                      # How often to sync consumer group offsets
  paused: false                       # Enable consumer offset synchronization
  group_filters:
  - pattern_type: PREFIX
    filter_type: INCLUDE
    name: prod-consumer-              # Include production consumer groups
  - pattern_type: LITERAL
    filter_type: EXCLUDE
    name: test-consumer-group         # Exclude specific test groups
----

**Important consumer group considerations**

**Avoid name conflicts:** If you plan to consume data from the shadow cluster, do not use the same consumer group names as those used on the source cluster. While this won't break shadow linking, it can impact your RPO/RTO because conflicting group names may interfere with offset replication and consumer resumption during disaster recovery.

**Offset clamping:** When Redpanda replicates consumer group offsets from the source cluster, offsets are automatically "clamped" during the commit process on the shadow cluster. If a committed offset from the source cluster is above the high watermark (HWM) of the corresponding shadow partition, Redpanda clamps the offset to the shadow partition's HWM before committing it to the shadow cluster. This ensures offsets remain valid and prevents consumers from seeking beyond available data on the shadow cluster.

=== Starting offset for new shadow topics

When the xref:manage:disaster-recovery/shadowing/overview.adoc#shadow-link-tasks[Source Topic Sync task] creates a shadow topic for the first time, you can control where replication begins on the source topic. This setting only applies to empty shadow partitions and is crucial for disaster recovery planning. Changing this configuration only affects new shadow topics, existing shadow topics continue replicating from their current position.

[,yaml]
----
topic_metadata_sync_options:
  start_at_earliest: {}
----

Alternatively, to start from the most recent offset:
[,yaml]
----
topic_metadata_sync_options:
  start_at_latest: {}
----

Or to start from a specific timestamp:
[,yaml]
----
topic_metadata_sync_options:
  start_at_timestamp: 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z
----

**Starting offset options:**

* **`earliest`** (default): Replicates all existing data from the source topic. Use this for complete disaster recovery where you need full data history.

* **`latest`**: Starts replication from the current end of the source topic, skipping existing data. Use this when you only need new data for disaster recovery and want to minimize initial replication time.

* **`timestamp`**: Starts replication from the first record with a timestamp at or after the specified time. Use this for point-in-time disaster recovery scenarios.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The starting offset only affects **new shadow topics**. After a shadow topic exists and has data, changing this setting has no effect on that topic's replication.
====

=== Generate a sample configuration

Use `rpk` to generate a sample configuration file with common filter patterns:

[,bash]
----
rpk shadow config generate -o shadow-config.yaml
----

This creates a template configuration file that you can customize for your environment. For detailed command options, see xref:reference:rpk/rpk-shadow/rpk-shadow-config-generate.adoc[`rpk shadow config generate`].

=== Networking

Configure network connectivity between your source and shadow clusters to enable shadow link replication. The shadow cluster initiates connections to the source cluster using a pull-based architecture.

For additional details about networking, see <<network-and-authentication>>.

==== Connection requirements

* **Direction**: Shadow cluster connects to source cluster (outbound from shadow, inbound to source)
* **Protocol**: Kafka protocol over TCP (default port 9092, or your configured listener ports)
* **Persistence**: Connections remain active for continuous replication

==== Firewall configuration

You must configure firewall rules to allow the shadow cluster to reach the source cluster.

**On the source cluster network:**

* Allow inbound TCP connections on Kafka listener ports (typically 9092).
* Allow connections from the shadow cluster's IP addresses or subnets.

**On the shadow cluster network:**

* Allow outbound TCP connections to the source cluster's Kafka listener ports.
* Ensure DNS resolution works for source cluster hostnames.

==== Bootstrap servers

Specify multiple bootstrap servers in your shadow link configuration for high availability:

[,yaml]
----
client_options:
  bootstrap_servers:                  # Source cluster brokers to connect to
  - <source-broker-1>:<port>          # Example: "prod-kafka-1.example.com:9092"
  - <source-broker-2>:<port>          # Example: "prod-kafka-2.example.com:9092"
  - <source-broker-3>:<port>          # Example: "prod-kafka-3.example.com:9092"
----

The shadow cluster uses these addresses to discover all brokers in the source cluster. If one bootstrap server is unavailable, the shadow cluster tries the next one in the list.

==== Network security

For production deployments, secure the network connection between clusters:

**TLS encryption:**
[,yaml]
----
client_options:
  tls_settings:
    enabled: true                     # Enable TLS
    tls_file_settings:
      ca_path: <ca-cert-path>         # Path to CA certificate, example: "/etc/ssl/certs/ca.crt"
      key_path: <client-key-path>     # Optional: Path to client private key, example: "/etc/ssl/private/client.key"
      cert_path: <client-cert-path>   # Optional: Path to client certificate, example: "/etc/ssl/certs/client.crt"
    do_not_set_sni_hostname: false   # Optional: Skip SNI hostname when using TLS (default: false)
----

**Authentication:**
[,yaml]
----
client_options:
  authentication_configuration:
    scram_configuration:
      username: <sasl-username>       # SASL/SCRAM username, example: "shadow-replication-user"
      password: <sasl-password>       # SASL/SCRAM password, example: "secure-password-123"
      scram_mechanism: SCRAM_SHA_256  # SCRAM mechanism: "SCRAM_SHA_256" or "SCRAM_SHA_512"
----

==== Connection tuning

Adjust connection parameters based on your network characteristics. For example:

[,yaml]
----
client_options:
  # Connection and metadata settings
  connection_timeout_ms: 1000         # Default 1000ms, increase for high-latency networks
  retry_backoff_ms: 100               # Default 100ms, backoff between connection retries
  metadata_max_age_ms: 10000          # Default 10000ms, how often to refresh cluster metadata
  
  # Fetch request settings
  fetch_wait_max_ms: 500              # Default 500ms, max time to wait for fetch requests
  fetch_min_bytes: 5242880            # Default 5MB, minimum bytes to fetch per request
  fetch_max_bytes: 20971520           # Default 20MB, maximum bytes to fetch per request
  fetch_partition_max_bytes: 1048576  # Default 1MB, maximum bytes to fetch per partition
----


== Update an existing shadow link

To modify a shadow link configuration after creation, run:

[,bash]
----
rpk shadow update <shadow-link-name>
----

For detailed command options, see xref:reference:rpk/rpk-shadow/rpk-shadow-update.adoc[`rpk shadow update`].

This opens your default editor to modify the shadow link configuration. Only changed fields are updated on the server. The shadow link name cannot be changed - you must delete and recreate the link to rename it.

[TIP]
====
Use xref:get-started:config-rpk-profile.adoc[`rpk profile`] to save your cluster connection details and credentials for both source and shadow clusters. This allows you to easily switch between the two configurations.
