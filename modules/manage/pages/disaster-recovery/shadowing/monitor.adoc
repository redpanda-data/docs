Monitor your shadow links to ensure proper replication performance and understand your disaster recovery readiness. Use `rpk` commands, metrics, and status information to track shadow link health and troubleshoot issues.

To check your shadow link status and ensure proper operation:

ifndef::env-cloud[]
// tag::rpk-tab-shadow-status[]
[,bash]
----
rpk shadow status <shadow-link-name>

// end::rpk-tab-shadow-status[]

For troubleshooting specific issues, you can use command options to show individual status sections. See xref:reference:rpk/rpk-shadow/rpk-shadow-status.adoc[`rpk shadow status`] for available status options. The status output includes the following:

# Get Data Plane API URL of shadow cluster
include::manage:partial$shadow-cluster-get-dataplane-api-url.adoc[]

curl "https://$DATAPLANE_API_URL/v1/shadowlinks/<shadow-link-name>" \

The responses include the following:
endif::[]

* **Shadow link state**: Overall operational state (`ACTIVE`, `PAUSED`).
* **Individual topic states**: Current state of each replicated topic (`ACTIVE`, `FAULTED`, `FAILING_OVER`, `FAILED_OVER`, `PAUSED`).
* **Task status**: Health of replication tasks across brokers (`ACTIVE`, `FAULTED`, `NOT_RUNNING`, `LINK_UNAVAILABLE`). For details about shadow link tasks, see xref:manage:disaster-recovery/shadowing/setup.adoc#shadow-link-tasks[Shadow link tasks].
* **Lag information**: Replication lag per partition showing source vs shadow high watermarks (HWM).

[[shadow-link-metrics]]
== Metrics

Shadowing provides comprehensive metrics to track replication performance and health with the xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc[`public_metrics`] endpoint.

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Metric |Type |Description

|`redpanda_shadow_link_shadow_lag`
|Gauge
|The lag of the shadow partition against the source partition, calculated as source partition LSO (Last Stable Offset) minus shadow partition HWM (High Watermark). Monitor by `shadow_link_name`, `topic`, and `partition` to understand replication lag for each partition.

|`redpanda_shadow_link_total_bytes_fetched`
|Count
|The total number of bytes fetched by a sharded replicator (bytes received by the client). Labeled by `shadow_link_name` and `shard` to track data transfer volume from the source cluster.

|`redpanda_shadow_link_total_bytes_written`
|Count
|The total number of bytes written by a sharded replicator (bytes written to the write_at_offset_stm). Uses `shadow_link_name` and `shard` labels to monitor data written to the shadow cluster.

|`redpanda_shadow_link_client_errors`
|Count
|The number of errors seen by the client. Track by `shadow_link_name` and `shard` to identify connection or protocol issues between clusters.

|`redpanda_shadow_link_shadow_topic_state`
|Gauge
|Number of shadow topics in the respective states. Labeled by `shadow_link_name` and `state` to monitor topic state distribution across your shadow links.

|`redpanda_shadow_link_total_records_fetched`
|Count
|The total number of records fetched by the sharded replicator (records received by the client). Monitor by `shadow_link_name` and `shard` to track message throughput from the source.

|`redpanda_shadow_link_total_records_written`
|Count
|The total number of records written by a sharded replicator (records written to the write_at_offset_stm). Uses `shadow_link_name` and `shard` labels to monitor message throughput to the shadow cluster.

== Monitoring best practices

=== Health check procedures

Establish regular monitoring workflows to ensure shadow link health:

ifndef::env-cloud[]
// tag::rpk-tab-health-checks[]
[,bash]
----
# Check all shadow links are active
rpk shadow list | grep -v "ACTIVE" || echo "All shadow links healthy"

# Monitor lag for critical topics
rpk shadow status <shadow-link-name> | grep -E "LAG|Lag"
----
// end::rpk-tab-health-checks[]
endif::[]

  jq -r 'if all(.state == "SHADOW_LINK_STATE_ACTIVE") then "All shadow links healthy" else .[] | select(.state != "SHADOW_LINK_STATE_ACTIVE") end'

# Monitor lag for critical topics

endif::[]

=== Alert conditions

Configure monitoring alerts for the following conditions, which indicate problems with Shadowing:

* **High replication lag**: When `redpanda_shadow_link_shadow_lag` exceeds your RPO requirements
* **Connection errors**: When `redpanda_shadow_link_client_errors` increases rapidly
* **Topic state changes**: When topics move to `FAULTED` state
* **Task failures**: When replication tasks enter `FAULTED` or `NOT_RUNNING` states
* **Throughput drops**: When bytes/records fetched drops significantly
* **Link unavailability**: When tasks show `LINK_UNAVAILABLE` indicating source cluster connectivity issues
