= Configure Redpanda for FIPS 
:description: Configure Redpanda to operate in FIPS compliance mode.
:page-aliases: security:fips-compliance.adoc

Redpanda provides FIPS-compliant cipher enforcement for brokers using OpenSSL 3.0.9, which is https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4282[validated^] for https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/140-2/upd2/final[140-2^] and is undergoing validation by NIST for https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/140-3/final[140-3^]. Both Redpanda and `rpk` leverage validated OpenSSL libraries for all security-related cryptography operations.

== Prerequisites

Before configuring brokers to run in FIPS compliance mode (FIPS mode), check to make sure the `redpanda-rpk-fips` and `redpanda-fips` packages are xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/manual/production/production-deployment.adoc#install-redpanda-for-fips-compliance[installed]. These packages are required by both the `redpanda` and `redpanda-tuners` install packages.

== Configure FIPS

When you configure a broker to run in FIPS mode:

* FIPS compliance is enforced _immediately_ upon the startup of Redpanda.

* Redpanda and its dependencies only use FIPS-validated cryptographic modules for all cryptographic algorithms used in a security context.

Redpanda logs an error and exits immediately if:

* The underlying operating system and crypto module are not running in FIPS mode.

* The underlying cryptography module enters into an error state.

* It cannot detect a FIPS-validated library.

To place a broker in FIPS compliance mode, enable xref:reference:properties/broker-properties.adoc#fips_mode[`fips_mode`] in the Redpanda broker configuration file (typically located in `/etc/redpanda/redpanda.yaml`). All fields are within the `redpanda` object:

```bash
redpanda:
  # ....
  fips_mode: enabled
```

Available `fips_mode` values are:

* `disabled`: Redpanda is not running in FIPS compliance mode. 

* `enabled`: When Redpanda starts up, it looks for a value of `1` in the file `/proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled`. If the file doesn't exist or doesn't contain `1`, Redpanda logs an error and exits immediately.

* `permissive`: This setting is a safety value option only, and _should not be used in a production environment_. If specified, Redpanda logs a WARNING, but continues operations even if the underlying operating system is not configured for FIPS. If set, your Redpanda instance is _not_ running in FIPS compliance mode.

=== FIPS OpenSSL configuration

You must specify the following SSL configurations for brokers you want to run in FIPS compliance mode: 

* `openssl_config_file`: Specifies the path to the OpenSSL configuration file that was created as part of the `redpanda-fips` package installation.  This file is used when OpenSSL is initialized to find the `fipsmodule.cnf` file that was created by the `openssl fipsinstall` command. Typically, this value should be `/opt/redpanda/openssl/openssl.cnf`.

* `openssl_module_directory`: Specifies the path to the directory that contains the `fips.so` cryptographic provider. Typically, this value should be: `/opt/redpanda/lib/ossl-modules/`.
+
The following configuration starts Redpanda in FIPS mode: 
+
```bash
redpanda:
  # ....
  fips_mode: enabled
  openssl_config_file: /opt/redpanda/openssl/openssl.cnf
  openssl_module_directory: /opt/redpanda/lib/ossl-modules/
```
