[NOTE]
====
All concepts described in this section are compatible with Kafka and its client libraries and CLIs. This section does not cover ways you can protect your Redpanda cluster externally; for example, through network ACLs or private networks.


Use the link:api/doc/admin/operation/operation-get_security_report[`/v1/security/report`] Admin API endpoint to generate a comprehensive security report for your cluster. This endpoint provides detailed information about TLS configuration, authentication methods, authorization status, and security alerts across all Redpanda interfaces (Kafka, RPC, Admin, Schema Registry, HTTP Proxy).
