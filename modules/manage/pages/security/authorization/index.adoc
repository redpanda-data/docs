= Redpanda Authorization Mechanisms
:description: Redpanda provides two mechanisms for controlling user permissions.
:page-aliases: security:authorization/index.adoc, manage:security/authorization.adoc

Authorization works in tandem with xref:security/authentication.adoc[authentication]. Authentication grants permission to interact with Redpanda resources while authorization controls what a principal is permitted to do once authenticated.

[NOTE]
====
Role-based access control (RBAC) is only available for Redpanda self-hosted users. You can only configure RBAC through the use of command-line RPK commands.
