Authorization works in tandem with xref:security/authentication.adoc[authentication]. Authentication grants permission to interact with Redpanda resources while authorization controls what a principal is permitted to do once authenticated.

[NOTE]
====
At the present time, RBAC is only available for Redpanda self-hosted users. You can only configure RBAC through the use of command-line RPK commands.
