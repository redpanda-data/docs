Authorization works in tandem with xref:security/authentication.adoc[authentication]. Authentication grants permission to interact with Redpanda resources while authorization controls what a principal is permitted to do once authenticated.

* xref:manage:security/authorization/acl.adoc[Access Control Lists (ACLs)]: Define fine-grained per-resource permissions for individual users or roles.
* xref:manage:security/authorization/rbac.adoc[Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)]: Group permissions into roles and assign roles to users for easier management at scale.
* xref:manage:security/authorization/gbac.adoc[Group-Based Access Control (GBAC)]: Assign permissions to OIDC groups so that users inherit access based on their IdP group membership.
