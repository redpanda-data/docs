= Configure Listeners
:description: Use listeners to advertise the location of the broker, so other brokers in the cluster can be found.
:page-aliases: cluster-administration:listener-configuration.adoc
:page-categories: Management, Security

Apache Kafka® client libraries must be able to connect to every Redpanda broker instance. If the client and broker are on different subnets, advertise the location of the broker in the Redpanda configuration file so other brokers in the cluster can be found. If not, clients connecting to brokers outside their local network experience connectivity issues.

To try out Redpanda, see the xref:get-started:quick-start.adoc[Redpanda quickstart].

== Anatomy of a listener

Clients connect to Redpanda over TCP. A listener is defined by an interface address and port on the machine running Redpanda. For example:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Configuration | Description

|`address: 0.0.0.0`
|Listens on all available interfaces.

|`port: 9092`
|TCP port for Kafka clients.

|===

[source,yaml]
----
redpanda:
  kafka_api:
    - address: 0.0.0.0
      port: 9092
----

== Advertise a listener

By default, the advertised address is the same as the bound address. For clients outside the local host or subnet, you must set an externally reachable address or hostname. Invalid settings, including `0.0.0.0`, will fail startup validation.

[source,yaml]
----
redpanda:
  advertised_kafka_api:
    - address: 192.168.4.1 # Broker’s routable IP or FQDN
      port: 9092
----

[NOTE]
====
* Use a valid hostname or IP. Do not use `0.0.0.0`.
* When using a DNS hostname, ensure that clients can resolve it and that it matches any TLS certificate Subject Alternative Name (SAN).
====

== Multiple listeners

You can define multiple Kafka API listeners to support different interfaces, ports, or authentication methods. Each listener must have a unique `name` property, and the same `name` property must be used in the corresponding `advertised_kafka_api` stanza.

For details about authentication methods, see xref:reference:properties/broker-properties.adoc#authentication_method[`authentication_method`] broker property.

[source,yaml]
----
redpanda:
  kafka_api:
    - name: local # Unique listener name
      address: 127.0.0.1
      port: 9092

    - name: subnet
      address: 192.168.4.1
      port: 9093

  advertised_kafka_api:
    - name: local # Must match the listener name
      address: 127.0.0.1
      port: 9092

    - name: subnet
      address: 192.168.4.1
      port: 9093
----

== TLS listeners and DNS hostnames

For encrypted connections, you typically advertise a DNS name matching your TLS certificate. Always include a `name` property for the TLS listener and use it in both `kafka_api` and `advertised_kafka_api`.

[source,yaml]
----
redpanda:
  kafka_api:
    - name: tls_listener
      address: 0.0.0.0
      port: 9094
      authentication_method: mtls_identity

  advertised_kafka_api:
    - name: tls_listener
      address: https://kafka.example.com
      port: 9094

  kafka_api_tls:
    - name: tls_listener
      enabled: true
      key_file: /etc/redpanda/tls/broker.key
      cert_file: /etc/redpanda/tls/broker.crt
      truststore_file: /etc/redpanda/tls/ca.crt
      require_client_auth: true
----

Ensure `kafka.example.com` matches the SAN in `broker.crt` and that clients trust the `ca.crt`.

== Mixed-mode authentication with multiple listeners

Redpanda supports running multiple authentication schemes concurrently. Each listener can specify its xref:reference:properties/broker-properties.adoc#authentication_method[authentication method], and must define a `name` property.

[source,yaml]
----
redpanda:
  kafka_api:
    - name: sasl_listener
      address: 0.0.0.0
      port: 9092
      authentication_method: sasl

    - name: mtls_listener
      address: 0.0.0.0
      port: 9192
      authentication_method: mtls_identity

  kafka_api_tls:
    - name: mtls_listener
      key_file: mtls_broker.key
      cert_file: mtls_broker.crt
      truststore_file: mtls_ca.crt
      require_client_auth: true
----

== Listeners that can be advertised

[cols="1m,1m,2a"]
|===
| Listener | Advertised Listener | Description

|kafka_api
|advertised_kafka_api
|Kafka clients connect here.

|rpc_server
|advertised_rpc_api
|Other Redpanda brokers connect here.

|pandaproxy_api
|advertised_pandaproxy_api
|HTTP proxy clients connect here.

|===

For each advertised listener, match the `name` of the corresponding listener and provide a valid address and port.
