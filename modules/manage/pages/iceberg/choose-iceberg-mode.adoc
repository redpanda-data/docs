In xref:manage:iceberg/about-iceberg-topics.adoc#enable-iceberg-integration[Iceberg-enabled clusters], the `redpanda.iceberg.mode` topic property determines how Redpanda maps topic data to the Iceberg table structure. You can have the generated Iceberg table match the structure of an Avro or Protobuf schema in the Schema Registry, or you can use the `key_value` mode where Redpanda stores the record values as-is in the table. 

NOTE: The JSON Schema format is not supported for Iceberg topics. If your topic data is in JSON, use the `key_value` mode. 

== Supported Iceberg modes

ifdef::env-cloud[]
Redpanda supports the following modes for Iceberg topics:
endif::[]

=== key_value

Creates an Iceberg table using a simple schema, consisting of two columns, one for the record metadata including the key, and another binary column for the record's value.

=== value_schema_id_prefix

Creates an Iceberg table whose structure matches the Redpanda schema for the topic, with columns corresponding to each field. You must register a schema in the xref:manage:schema-reg/schema-reg-overview.adoc[Schema Registry] and producers must write to the topic using the Schema Registry wire format.

In the xref:manage:schema-reg/schema-reg-overview.adoc#wire-format[Schema Registry wire format], a "magic byte" and schema ID are embedded in the message payload header. Producers to the topic must use the wire format in the serialization process so Redpanda can determine the schema used for each record, use the schema to define the Iceberg table, and store the topic values in the corresponding table columns.

=== value_schema_latest

Creates an Iceberg table whose structure matches the latest schema registered for the subject in the Schema Registry. You must register a schema in the Schema Registry. Unlike the `value_schema_id_prefix` mode, `value_schema_latest` does not require that producers use the wire format.

The latest schema is cached periodically. The cache period is defined by the cluster property `iceberg_latest_schema_cache_ttl_ms` (default: 5 minutes).

=== disabled

Default for `redpanda.iceberg.mode`. Disables writing to an Iceberg table for the topic.

[NOTE]
====
The following modes are compatible with producing to an Iceberg topic using Redpanda Console:

- `key_value`
- Starting in version 25.2, `value_schema_latest` with a JSON schema

Otherwise, records may fail to write to the Iceberg table and instead write to the xref:manage:iceberg/about-iceberg-topics.adoc#manage-dead-letter-queue[dead-letter queue].
====

== Configure Iceberg mode for a topic

You can set the Iceberg mode for a topic when you create the topic, or you can update the mode for an existing topic.

.Option 1. Create a new topic and set `redpanda.iceberg.mode`:
[,bash]
----
rpk topic create <topic-name> --topic-config=redpanda.iceberg.mode=<iceberg-mode>
----

.Option 2. Set `redpanda.iceberg.mode` for an existing topic:
[,bash]
----
rpk topic alter-config <new-topic-name> --set redpanda.iceberg.mode=<iceberg-mode>
----

[[override-value-schema-latest-default]]
=== Override `value_schema_latest` default

ifndef::env-cloud[]
In `value_schema_latest` mode, you only need to set the property value to the string `value_schema_latest`. This enables the default behavior of `value_schema_latest` mode, which determines the subject for the topic using the xref:manage:schema-reg/schema-id-validation.adoc#set-subject-name-strategy-per-topic[TopicNameStrategy]. For example, if your topic is named `sensor` the schema is looked up in the `sensor-value` subject. For Protobuf data, the default behavior also deserializes records using the first message defined in the corresponding Protobuf schema stored in the Schema Registry.
endif::[]

ifdef::env-cloud[]
In `value_schema_latest` mode, you only need to set the property value to the string `value_schema_latest`. This enables the default behavior of `value_schema_latest` mode, which determines the subject for the topic using the TopicNameStrategy. For example, if your topic is named `sensor` the schema is looked up in the `sensor-value` subject. For Protobuf data, the default behavior also deserializes records using the first message defined in the corresponding Protobuf schema stored in the Schema Registry.
endif::[]

If you use a different strategy other than the topic name to derive the subject name, you can override the default behavior of `value_schema_latest` mode and explicitly set the subject name.

To override the default behavior, use the following optional syntax:

[,bash]
----
value_schema_latest:subject=<subject-name>,protobuf_name=<protobuf-message-full-name>
----

* For both Avro and Protobuf, specify a different subject name by using the key-value pair `subject=<subject-name>`, for example `value_schema_latest:subject=sensor-data`.
* For Protobuf only:
** Specify a different message definition by using a key-value pair `protobuf_name=<message-name>`, for example: `value_schema_latest:protobuf_name=com.example.manufacturing.SensorData`.
** To specify both a different subject and message definition, separate the key-value pairs with a comma, for example: `value_schema_latest:subject=my_protobuf_schema,protobuf_name=com.example.manufacturing.SensorData`.

== How Iceberg modes translate to table format

Redpanda generates an Iceberg table with the same name as the topic. In each mode, Redpanda writes to a `redpanda` table column that stores a single Iceberg https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#nested-types[struct^] per record, containing nested columns of the metadata from each record, including the record key, headers, timestamp, the partition it belongs to, and its offset. 

For example, if you produce to a topic `ClickEvent` according to the following Avro schema:

[,avro]
----
{
    "type": "record",
    "name": "ClickEvent",
    "fields": [
        {
            "name": "user_id",
            "type": "int"
        },
        {
            "name": "event_type",
            "type": "string"
        },
        {
            "name": "ts",
            "type": "string"
        }
    ]
}
----

The `key_value` mode writes to the following table format:

[,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE ClickEvent (
    redpanda struct<
        partition: integer NOT NULL,
        timestamp: timestamp NOT NULL,
        offset:    long NOT NULL,
        headers:   array<struct<key: binary NOT NULL, value: binary>>,
        key:       binary
    >,
    value binary
)
----

Use `key_value` mode if the topic data is in JSON or if you are able to use the Iceberg data in its semi-structured format.

The `value_schema_id_prefix` and `value_schema_latest` modes can use the schema to translate to the following table format:

[,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE ClickEvent (
    redpanda struct<
        partition: integer NOT NULL,
        timestamp: timestamp NOT NULL,
        offset:    long NOT NULL,
        headers:   array<struct<key: binary NOT NULL, value: binary>>,
        key:       binary
    >,
    user_id integer NOT NULL,
    event_type string,
    ts string
)
----

As you produce records to the topic, the data also becomes available in object storage for Iceberg-compatible clients to consume. You can use the same analytical tools to xref:manage:iceberg/query-iceberg-topics.adoc[read the Iceberg topic data] in a data lake as you would for a relational database.

If Redpanda fails to translate the record to the columnar format as defined by the schema, it writes the record to a dead-letter queue (DLQ) table. See xref:manage:iceberg/about-iceberg-topics.adoc#manage-dead-letter-queue[Manage dead-letter queue] for more information.

=== Schema types translation

Redpanda supports direct translations of the following types to Iceberg value domains:

[tabs]
======
Avro::
+
--
|===
| Avro type | Iceberg type

| boolean | boolean
| int | int
| long | long
| float | float
| double | double
| bytes | binary
| string | string
| record | struct
| array | list
| maps | map
| fixed | fixed*
| decimal | decimal
| uuid | uuid*
| date | date
| time | time*
| timestamp | timestamp
|===

*These types are not currently supported in Unity Catalog managed Iceberg tables.

There are some cases where the Avro type does not map directly to an Iceberg type and Redpanda applies the following transformations:

* Different flavors of time (such as `time-millis`) and timestamp (such as `timestamp-millis`) types are translated to the same Iceberg `time` and `timestamp` types, respectively.
* Avro unions are flattened to Iceberg structs with optional fields. For example:
** The union `["int", "long", "float"]` is represented as an Iceberg struct `struct<0 INT NULLABLE, 1 LONG  NULLABLE, 2 FLOAT NULLABLE>`.
** The union `["int", null, "float"]` is represented as an Iceberg struct `struct<0 INT NULLABLE, 1 FLOAT NULLABLE>`.
* All fields are required by default. (Avro always sets a default in binary representation.)

Some Avro types are not supported:

* The Avro `duration` logical type is ignored.
* The Avro `null` type is ignored and not represented in the Iceberg schema.
* Recursive types are not supported.
--

Protobuf::
+
--
|===
| Protobuf type | Iceberg type

| bool | boolean
| double | double
| float | float
| int32 | int
| sint32 | int
| int64 | long
| sint64 | long
| sfixed32 | int
| sfixed64 | long
| string | string
| bytes | binary
| map | map
| message | struct
|===

There are some cases where the Protobuf type does not map directly to an Iceberg type and Redpanda applies the following transformations:

* Repeated values are translated into Iceberg `array` types.
* Enums are translated into Iceberg `int` types based on the integer value of the enumerated type.
* `uint32` and `fixed32` are translated into Iceberg `long` types as that is the existing semantic for unsigned 32-bit values in Iceberg.
* `uint64` and `fixed64` values are translated into their Base-10 string representation.
* `google.protobuf.Timestamp` is translated into `timestamp` in Iceberg.

Recursive types are not supported.
