The Apache Iceberg integration for Redpanda allows you to store topic data in the cloud in the Iceberg open table format. This makes your streaming data immediately available in downstream analytical systems, including data warehouses like Snowflake, Databricks, Clickhouse, and Redshift, without setting up and maintaining additional ETL pipelines. You can also integrate your data directly into commonly-used big data processing frameworks, such as Apache Spark and Flink, standardizing and simplifying the consumption of streams as tables in a wide variety of data analytics pipelines.

The Iceberg integration uses xref:manage:tiered-storage.adoc[Tiered Storage]. When a cluster or topic has Tiered Storage enabled, Redpanda stores the Iceberg files in the configured Tiered Storage bucket or container.

Redpanda supports https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#format-versioning[version 2^] of the Iceberg table format.

== Prerequisites

* Install xref:get-started:rpk-install.adoc[`rpk`].
* To check if you already have a license key applied to your cluster:
+
[,bash]
----
rpk cluster license info
----
* Enable xref:manage:tiered-storage.adoc#set-up-tiered-storage[Tiered Storage] for the topics for which you want to generate Iceberg tables.

== Limitations

* It is not possible to append topic data to an existing Iceberg table that is not created by Redpanda.
* If you enable the Iceberg integration on an existing Redpanda topic, Redpanda does not backfill the generated Iceberg table with topic data.
* JSON schemas are not currently supported. If the topic data is in JSON, use the `key_value` mode to store the JSON in Iceberg, which then can be parsed by most query engines.
* If you are using Avro or Protobuf data, you must use the Schema Registry wire format, where producers include the magic byte and schema ID in the message payload header. See also: xref:manage:schema-reg/schema-id-validation.adoc[] and the https://www.redpanda.com/blog/schema-registry-kafka-streaming#how-does-serialization-work-with-schema-registry-in-kafka[Understanding Apache Kafka Schema Registry^] blog post to learn more about the wire format.

== Iceberg concepts 

Apache Iceberg is an open source format specification for defining structured tables in a data lake. The table format lets you quickly and easily manage, query, and process huge amounts of structured and unstructured data. This is similar to the way in which you would manage and run SQL queries against relational data in a database or data warehouse. The open format lets you use many different languages, tools, and applications to process the same data in a consistent way, so you can avoid vendor lock-in. This data management system is referred to as a _data lakehouse_.

In the Iceberg specification, tables consist of the following layers:

* Data layer
** Data files: Store the data. The Iceberg integration currently supports the Parquet file format. Parquet files are column-based and suitable for analytical workloads at scale. They come with compression capabilities that optimize files for object storage. 
* Metadata layer: Stores table metadata separately from data files. The metadata layer allows multiple writers to stage metadata changes and apply updates atomically. It also supports database snapshots, and time travel queries that query the database at a previous point in time. 
+
--
** Manifest files: Track data files and contain metadata about these files, such as record count, partition membership, and file paths.
** Manifest list: Tracks all the manifest files belonging to a table, including file paths and upper and lower bounds for partition fields. 
** Metadata file: Stores metadata about the table, including its schema, partition information, and snapshots. Whenever a change is made to the table, a new metadata file is created and becomes the latest version of the metadata in the catalog.
--
+
In the Redpanda Iceberg integration, the manifest files are in JSON format.
* Catalog: Contains the current metadata pointer for the table. Clients reading and writing data to the table see the same version of the current state of the table. The Iceberg integration supports two <<access-data-in-iceberg-tables,catalog integration>> types. You can configure Redpanda to catalog files stored in the same object storage bucket or container where the Iceberg data files are located, or you can configure Redpanda to use an https://iceberg.apache.org/concepts/catalog/#decoupling-using-the-rest-catalog[Iceberg REST catalog^] endpoint to update an externally-managed catalog when there are changes to the Iceberg data and metadata.

When you enable the Iceberg integration for a Redpanda topic, Redpanda brokers store streaming data in the Iceberg-compatible format in Parquet files in object storage, in addition to the log segments uploaded using Tiered Storage. Storing the streaming data in Iceberg tables in the cloud allows you to derive real-time insights through many compatible data lakehouse, data engineering, and business intelligence https://iceberg.apache.org/vendors/[tools^]. 

== Enable Iceberg integration

To create an Iceberg table for a Redpanda topic, you must set the cluster configuration property xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#iceberg_enabled[`iceberg_enabled`] to `true`, and also configure the topic property xref:reference:properties/topic-properties.adoc#redpandaicebergmode[`redpanda.iceberg.mode`]. You can choose to provide a schema if you need the Iceberg table to be structured with defined columns.

. Set the `iceberg_enabled` configuration option on your cluster to `true`. You must restart your cluster if you change this configuration for a running cluster. 
+
[,bash]
----
rpk cluster config set iceberg_enabled true 
----
+
[,bash,role=no-copy]
----
Successfully updated configuration. New configuration version is 2.
----

. (Optional) Create a new topic.
+
[,bash,]
----
rpk topic create <new-topic-name>
----
+
[,bash,role=no-copy]
----
TOPIC            STATUS
<new-topic-name>   OK
----
+
To implement partitioning for the Iceberg topic, configure the config_ref:redpanda.iceberg.partition.spec,true,properties/topic-properties[] topic property.
+
[,bash,]
----
# Create new topic with five topic partitions, replication factor 1, and custom table partitioning for Iceberg
rpk topic create <new-topic-name> -p5 -r1 -c "redpanda.iceberg.partition.spec=<( ...)>"
----
+
The `<partition-key>` value is either a column name or a transformation of a column, defining how to partition the Iceberg table data. Iceberg stores records in files based on this expression. 
+
For example: 
+
--
* To partition the table by a single column `col1`, use: `redpanda.iceberg.partition.spec=(col1)`. 
* To partition by multiple columns, use a comma separated list: `redpanda.iceberg.partition.spec=(col1, col2)`. 
* To partition by the year of a timestamp column `ts1` and `col1`, use: `redpanda.iceberg.partition.spec=(year(ts1), col1)`.
--


. Enable the integration for the topic by configuring `redpanda.iceberg.mode`. You can choose one of the following modes:
+
--
* `key_value`: Creates an Iceberg table using a simple schema, consisting of two columns, one for the record metadata including the key, and another binary column for the record's value.
* `value_schema_id_prefix`: Creates an Iceberg table whose structure matches the Redpanda schema for this topic, with columns corresponding to each field. You must register a schema in the Schema Registry (see next step), and producers must write to the topic using the Schema Registry wire format. Redpanda parses the schema used by the record based on the schema ID encoded in the payload header, and stores the topic values in the corresponding table columns. 
* `disabled` (default): Disables writing to an Iceberg table for this topic.
--
+
[,bash]
----
rpk topic alter-config <new-topic-name> --set redpanda.iceberg.mode=<topic-iceberg-mode>
----
+
[,bash,role=no-copy]
----
TOPIC            STATUS
<new-topic-name>   OK
----

. Register a schema for the topic. This step is required for the `value_schema_id_prefix` mode, but is optional otherwise.
+
[,bash]
----
rpk registry schema create <subject-name> --schema </path-to-schema> --type <format>
----
+
[,bash,role=no-copy]
----
SUBJECT                VERSION   ID   TYPE
<subject-name>   1         1    PROTOBUF
----

The Iceberg table is inside a namespace called `redpanda`, and has the same name as the Redpanda topic name. As you produce records to the topic, the data also becomes available in object storage for consumption by Iceberg-compatible clients. 

== Schema support and mapping

The `redpanda.iceberg.mode` property determines how Redpanda maps the topic data to the Iceberg table structure. You can either have the generated Iceberg table match the stucture of a Avro or Protobuf schema in the Schema Registry, or use the `key_value` mode where Redpanda stores the record values as-is in the table. 

The JSON Schema format is not supported. If your topic data is in JSON, it is recommended to use the `key_value` mode.

=== Iceberg modes and table schemas

For both `key_value` and `value_schema_id_prefix` modes, Redpanda writes to a `redpanda` table column that stores a single Iceberg https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#nested-types[struct^] per record, containing nested columns of the metadata from each record, including the record key, headers, timestamp, the partition it belongs to, and its offset. 

For example, if you produce to a topic according to the following Avro schema:

[,avro]
----
{
    "type": "record",
    "name": "ClickEvent",
    "fields": [
        {
            "name": "user_id",
            "type": "int"
        },
        {
            "name": "event_type",
            "type": "string"
        },
        {
            "name": "ts",
            "type": "string"
        }
    ]
}
----

The `key_value` mode writes to the following table format:

[,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE ClickEvent (
    redpanda struct<
        partition: integer NOT NULL,
        timestamp: timestamp NOT NULL,
        offset:    long NOT NULL,
        headers:   array<struct<key: binary NOT NULL, value: binary>>,
        key:       binary
    >,
    value binary
)
----

Consider this approach if the topic data is in JSON, or if you can use the Iceberg data in its semi-structured format.

The `value_schema_id_prefix` mode translates to the following table format:

[,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE ClickEvent (
    redpanda struct<
        partition: integer NOT NULL,
        timestamp: timestamp NOT NULL,
        offset:    long NOT NULL,
        headers:   array<struct<key: binary NOT NULL, value: binary>>,
        key:       binary
    >,
    user_id integer NOT NULL,
    event_type string,
    ts string
)
----

With schema integration, Redpanda uses the schema ID prefix embedded in each record to find the matching schema in the Schema Registry. Producers to the topic must use the schema ID prefix in the serialization process so Redpanda can determine the schema used for each record, parse the record according to that schema, and use the schema for the Iceberg table as well.

=== Schema types translation

Redpanda supports direct translations of the following types to Iceberg value domains:

[tabs]
======
Avro::
+
--
|===
| Avro type | Iceberg type

| boolean | boolean
| int | int
| long | long
| float | float
| double | double
| bytes | binary
| string | string
| record | struct
| array | list
| maps | list
| fixed | fixed
| decimal | decimal
| uuid | uuid
| date | date
| time | time
| timestamp | timestamp
|===

* Different flavors of time (such as `time-millis`) and timestamp (such as `timestamp-millis`) types are translated to the same Iceberg `time` and `timestamp` types respectively.
* Avro unions are flattened to Iceberg structs with optional fields:
** For example, the union `["int", "long", "float"]` is represented as an Iceberg struct `struct<0 INT NULLABLE, 1 LONG  NULLABLE, 2 FLOAT NULLABLE>`.
** The union `["int", null, "float"]` is represented as an Iceberg struct `struct<0 INT NULLABLE, 1 FLOAT NULLABLE>`.
* All fields are required by default (Avro always sets a default in binary representation).
* The Avro duration logical type is ignored.
* The Avro null type is ignored and not represented in the Iceberg schema.
* Recursive types are not supported.
--

Protobuf::
+
--
|===
| Protobuf type | Iceberg type

| bool | boolean
| double | double
| float | float
| int32 | int
| sint32 | int
| int64 | long
| sint64 | long
| sfixed32 | int
| sfixed64 | int
| string | string
| bytes | binary
| map | map
|===

* Repeated values are translated into Iceberg `array` types.
* Enums are translated into Iceberg `int` types based on the integer value of the enumerated type.
* `uint32` and `fixed32` are translated into Iceberg `long` types as that is the existing semantic for unsigned 32-bit values in Iceberg.
* `uint64` and `fixed64` values are translated into their Base-10 string representation.
* The `timestamp` type in Protobuf is translated into `timestamp` in Iceberg.
* Messages are converted into Iceberg structs.
* Recursive types are not supported.
--
======

=== Schema evolution

Redpanda supports schema evolution for Avro and Protobuf schemas. When you update the schema in Schema Registry, Redpanda automatically updates the Iceberg table schema to match the new schema.

For example, if you produce records to a topic `demo-topic` with the following Avro schema:

.schema_1.avsc
[,avro]
----
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "ClickEvent",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "user_id",
      "type": "int"
    },
    {
      "name": "event_type",
      "type": "string"
    }
  ]
}
----

[,bash]
----
rpk registry schema create demo-topic-value --schema schema_1.avsc

echo '{"user_id":23, "event_type":"BUTTON_CLICK"}' | rpk topic produce demo-topic --format='%v\n' --schema-id=topic
----

Then, you update the schema to add a new field `ts`, and produce records with the updated schema:

.schema_2.avsc
[,avro]
----
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "ClickEvent",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "user_id",
      "type": "int"
    },
    {
      "name": "event_type",
      "type": "string"
    }.
    {
      "name": "ts",
      "type": [
          "null",  
          { "type": "string", "logicalType": "date" }
        ],
      "default": null  # Default value for the new field
    }
  ]
}
----
The `ts` field can be either null or a string representing a date. The default value is null.

[,bash]
----
rpk registry schema create demo-topic-value --schema schema_2.avsc

echo '{"user_id":858, "event_type":"BUTTON_CLICK", "ts":{"string":"2025-02-26T20:05:23.230ZZ"}}' | rpk topic produce demo-topic --format='%v\n' --schema-id=topic
----

<<query-iceberg-tables,Querying the Iceberg table>> for `demo-topic` includes the new column `ts`:

[,bash,role=no-copy]
----
+---------+--------------+--------------------------+
| user_id | event_type   | ts                       |
+---------+--------------+--------------------------+
| 858     | BUTTON_CLICK | 2025-02-26T20:05:23.230Z |
| 23      | BUTTON_CLICK | NULL                     |
+---------+--------------+--------------------------+
----

== Access data in Iceberg tables

To read from the Iceberg table, your Iceberg-compatible client or tool needs access to the catalog to know the current state of the table. The catalog provides the location of the current metadata pointer. You can configure Redpanda to either store the table metadata in https://iceberg.apache.org/javadoc/1.5.0/org/apache/iceberg/hadoop/HadoopCatalog.html[HadoopCatalog^] format in the same object storage bucket or container, or connect to a REST-based catalog. 

Set the cluster configuration property `iceberg_catalog_type` with one of the following values:

* `object_storage` (default): Write catalog files to the same object storage bucket as the data files. Use the object storage URL with an Iceberg client to access the catalog and data files for your Redpanda Iceberg tables.
* `rest`: Connect to and update an Iceberg catalog using a REST API. See the https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/main/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml[Iceberg REST Catalog API specification].

The quickest way to access the data in Iceberg-enabled topics is to use the `object_storage` catalog type, and point your query engine to the table metadata path in the bucket or container. For production use cases, it is recommended to use a REST catalog integration to more easily manage governance, and ensure discoverability and consistency across multiple engines or tools. In either case, you use the catalog to load, query, or refresh the Iceberg data as you produce to the Redpanda topic. For specific guidance on adding the Iceberg tables to your data warehouse or lakehouse using the catalog, refer to the official documentation of your query engine or Iceberg-compatible tool. 

Once you have enabled the Iceberg integration for a topic and selected a catalog type, you cannot switch to another catalog type.

=== File system-based catalog (`object_storage`)

If you are using the `object_storage` catalog type, you must also set up the catalog integration in your processing engine using the location of the metadata in the bucket or container.

For example, you can configure Spark to use a file system-based catalog with at least the following properties, is using AWS S3 for object storage:

.Example Spark configuration for `object_storage` catalog type
[,spark]
----
spark.sql.catalog.streaming.type = hadoop
spark.sql.catalog.streaming.warehouse = s3a://<bucket-name>/path/to/redpanda-iceberg-table
----

Depending on your processing engine, you may need to specify the location for the metadata to <<query-iceberg-tables,query the table>>. You may also need to create a new table in your data warehouse or lakehouse for the Iceberg data.

==== Specify metadata location

The config_ref:iceberg_catalog_base_location,true,properties/cluster-properties[] property stores the base path for the file-system based catalog if using the `object_storage` catalog type. The default value is `redpanda-iceberg-catalog`. 

CAUTION: Do not change the `iceberg_catalog_base_location` value after you have enabled Iceberg integration for a topic.

If your engine needs the full JSON metadata path, use the following:

```
redpanda-iceberg-catalog/metadata/redpanda/<topic-name>/v<version-number>.metadata.json
```

This provides read access to a single snapshot (denoted by `version-number`) of a table. 

NOTE: You can disable snapshot expiry by setting 


=== REST catalog integration

For production use cases, Redpanda recommends the `rest` option with REST-enabled Iceberg catalog services such as https://docs.tabular.io/[Tabular^], https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/index.html[Databricks Unity^] and https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/opencatalog/overview[Snowflake Open Catalog^].

For an Iceberg REST catalog, set the following additional cluster configuration properties:

* iceberg_rest_catalog_endpoint,true,properties/cluster-properties[]: The endpoint URL for your Iceberg catalog, which you either manage directly, or is managed by an external catalog service.
* iceberg_rest_catalog_client_id,true,properties/cluster-properties[]: The ID to connect to the REST server.
* iceberg_rest_catalog_client_secret,true,properties/cluster-properties[]: The secret data to connect to the REST server.
+
--
For REST catalogs that use self-signed certificates, also configure these properties:

* iceberg_rest_catalog_trust_file,true,properties/cluster-properties[]: The path to a file containing a certificate chain to trust for the REST catalog.
* iceberg_rest_catalog_crl_file,true,properties/cluster-properties[]: The path to the certificate revocation list for the specified trust file.
--

See xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc[Cluster Configuration Properties] for the full list of cluster properties to configure for a catalog integration.

For example, if you have Redpanda cluster configuration properties set to connect to a REST catalog named `streaming`:

[,yaml]
----
iceberg_rest_catalog_type: rest 
iceberg_rest_catalog_endpoint: http://catalog-service:8181 
iceberg_rest_catalog_client_id: <rest-connection-user>
iceberg_rest_catalog_client_secret: <rest-connection-password>
----

And you use Spark as a processing engine, configured to use the `streaming` catalog:

.Example Spark configuration for `rest` catalog type
[,spark]
----
spark.sql.catalog.streaming = org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkCatalog
spark.sql.catalog.streaming.type = rest
spark.sql.catalog.streaming.uri = http://catalog-service:8181
----

Using Spark SQL, you can query the Iceberg table directly by specifying the catalog name:

[,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM streaming.redpanda.ClickEvent;
----

Spark can use the REST catalog to automatically discover the topic's Iceberg table. 

Depending on your processing engine, to <<query-iceberg-tables,query the Iceberg data>> you may need to create a new table in your data warehouse or lakehouse. See also: xref:manage:iceberg/redpanda-topics-iceberg-snowflake-catalog.adoc[]

== Query Iceberg tables

You can use the same analytical tools to access table data in a data lake as you would for a relational database.

For example, suppose you produce the same stream of events to a topic `ClickEvent`, which uses a schema, and another topic `ClickEvent_key_value`, which uses the key-value mode. The topics have Tiered Storage configured to an AWS S3 bucket. A sample record contains the following data:

[,bash,role=no-copy]
----
{"user_id": 2324, "event_type": "BUTTON_CLICK", "ts": "2024-11-25T20:23:59.380Z"}
----

When you point your Iceberg-compatible tool or framework to the object storage location of the Iceberg tables, how you consume the data depends on the topic Iceberg mode and whether you've registered a schema on which to derive the table format. Depending on the processing engine, you may need to first create a new table that gets added to your Iceberg catalog implementation.

In either mode, you do not need to rely on complex ETL jobs or pipelines to access real-time data from Redpanda in your data lakehouse.

=== Query topic with schema (`value_schema_id_prefix` mode)

In this example, it is assumed you have created the `ClickEvent` topic, set `redpanda.iceberg.mode` to `value_schema_id_prefix`, and are connecting to a REST-based Iceberg catalog. The following is an Avro schema for `ClickEvent`:

.`schema.avsc`
[,avro]
----
{
    "type" : "record",
    "namespace" : "com.redpanda.examples.avro",
    "name" : "ClickEvent",
    "fields" : [
       { "name": "user_id", "type" : "int" },
       { "name": "event_type", "type" : "string" },
       { "name": "ts", "type": "string" }
    ]
 }
----

You can register the schema under the `ClickEvent-value` subject:

[,bash]
----
rpk registry schema create ClickEvent-value --schema path/to/schema.avsc --type avro
----

You can then produce to the `ClickEvent` topic using the following format:

[,bash]
----
echo '"key1" {"user_id":2324,"event_type":"BUTTON_CLICK","ts":"2024-11-25T20:23:59.380Z"}' | rpk topic produce ClickEvent --format='%k %v\n' --schema-id=topic
----

The following SQL query returns values from columns in the `ClickEvent` table, with the table structure derived from the schema, and column names matching the schema fields. If you've integrated a catalog, query engines such as Spark SQL provide Iceberg integrations that allow easy discovery and access to existing Iceberg tables in object storage.

[,sql]
----
SELECT user_id, 
    event_type, 
    ts 
FROM <catalog-name>.ClickEvent;
----

[,bash,role=no-copy]
----
+---------+--------------+--------------------------+
| user_id | event_type   | ts                       |
+---------+--------------+--------------------------+
| 2324    | BUTTON_CLICK | 2024-11-25T20:23:59.380Z |
+---------+--------------+--------------------------+
----

=== Query topic in key-value mode

In `key_value` mode, you do not associate the topic with a schema in the Schema Registry, which means using semi-structured data in Iceberg. 

In this example, it is assumed you have created the `ClickEvent_key_value` topic, set `redpanda.iceberg.mode` to `key_value`, and are also connecting to a REST-based Iceberg catalog.

You can produce to the `ClickEvent_key_value` topic using the following format:

[,bash]
----
echo 'key1 {"user_id":2324,"event_type":"BUTTON_CLICK","ts":"2024-11-25T20:23:59.380Z"}' | rpk topic produce ClickEvent_key_value --format='%k %v\n'
----

This example queries the semi-structured data in the `ClickEvent_key_value` table, which also consists of another column `redpanda` containing the record key and other metadata:

[,sql]
----
SELECT 
    value
FROM <catalog-name>.ClickEvent_key_value;
----

[,bash,role=no-copy]
----
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| value                                                                        |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| {"user_id":2324,"event_type":"BUTTON_CLICK","ts":"2024-11-25T20:23:59.380Z"} |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
----

== Dead-letter queue

Errors may occur when writing records to the Iceberg table; for example, if the record does not match the topic schema, or you do not use the Schema Registry wire format and the schema is not found, or if an Avro or Protobuf data type cannot be translated to an Iceberg type.

If Redpanda encounters an error while writing a record to the Iceberg table, the record is dropped by default. To enable a dead-letter queue (DLQ) for these records, configure the config_ref:redpanda.iceberg.invalid.record.action,true,properties/topic-properties[] topic property. Redpanda writes these records to a separate Iceberg table named `<topic-name>~dlq`.

The DLQ table uses the `key_value` schema, consisting of two columns: the record metadata including the key, and a binary column for the record's value.

The DQL table allows you to inspect the records that failed to write to the Iceberg table, and take further action on these records such as transforming and reprocessing them, and debugging issues that may have occurred upstream.

For example, if the DLQ table contains the following record:

[,bash,role=no-copy]
----

----

You can apply a transformation and reprocess in your data lakehouse to the original Iceberg table:

[,sql]
