To read from the Redpanda-generated xref:manage:iceberg/topic-iceberg-integration.adoc[Iceberg table], your Iceberg-compatible client or tool needs access to the catalog to retrieve the table metadata and know the current state of the table. The catalog provides the current table metadata, which includes locations for all the table's data files. You can configure Redpanda to either connect to a REST-based catalog, or use a file-system based catalog. 

For production deployments, Redpanda recommends using an external REST catalog to manage Iceberg metadata. This enables built-in table maintenance, safely handles multiple engines and tools accessing tables at the same time, facilitates data governance, and maximizes data discovery. However, if it is not possible to use a REST catalog, you may use the file-system based catalog, which does not require you to maintain a separate service to access the Iceberg data. In either case, you use the catalog to load, query, or refresh the Iceberg table as you produce to the Redpanda topic. See the documentation for your query engine or Iceberg-compatible tool for specific guidance on adding the Iceberg tables to your data warehouse or lakehouse using the catalog. 

After you have selected a catalog type at the cluster level and xref:manage:iceberg/topic-iceberg-integration.adoc#enable-iceberg-integration[enabled the Iceberg integration] for a topic, you cannot switch to another catalog type.

== Connect to a REST catalog

Redpanda supports connecting to an Iceberg REST catalog, using the standard https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/main/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml[REST API^] supported by many catalog providers. Use this catalog integration type with REST-enabled Iceberg catalog services, such as https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/index.html[Databricks Unity^] and https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/opencatalog/overview[Snowflake Open Catalog^].

To connect to a REST catalog, set the following cluster configuration properties:

* config_ref:iceberg_catalog_type,true,properties/cluster-properties[`iceberg_catalog_type`]: `rest`
* config_ref:iceberg_rest_catalog_endpoint,true,properties/cluster-properties[`iceberg_rest_catalog_endpoint`]: The endpoint URL for your Iceberg catalog, which you either manage directly, or is managed by an external catalog service.
* config_ref:iceberg_rest_catalog_client_id,true,properties/cluster-properties[`iceberg_rest_catalog_client_id`]: The ID to connect to the REST catalog.
* config_ref:iceberg_rest_catalog_client_secret,true,properties/cluster-properties[`iceberg_rest_catalog_client_secret`]: The secret data to connect to the REST catalog.

For REST catalogs that use self-signed certificates, also configure these properties:

* config_ref:iceberg_rest_catalog_trust_file,true,properties/cluster-properties[`iceberg_rest_catalog_trust_file`]: The path to a file containing a certificate chain to trust for the REST catalog.
* config_ref:iceberg_rest_catalog_crl_file,true,properties/cluster-properties[`iceberg_rest_catalog_crl_file`]: The path to the certificate revocation list for the specified trust file.

See xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc[Cluster Configuration Properties] for the full list of cluster properties to configure for a catalog integration.

=== Example REST catalog configuration

For example, if you have Redpanda cluster configuration properties set to connect to a REST catalog:

[,yaml]
----
iceberg_catalog_type: rest 
iceberg_rest_catalog_endpoint: http://catalog-service:8181 
iceberg_rest_catalog_client_id: <rest-connection-user>
iceberg_rest_catalog_client_secret: <rest-connection-password>
----

And you use Apache Spark as a processing engine, configured to use a catalog named `streaming`:

[,spark]
----
spark.sql.catalog.streaming = org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkCatalog
spark.sql.catalog.streaming.type = rest
spark.sql.catalog.streaming.uri = http://catalog-service:8181
# You may need to configure additional properties based on your object storage provider.
# See https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-configuration/#catalog-configuration and https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html
# For example, for AWS S3:
# spark.sql.catalog.streaming.io-impl = org.apache.iceberg.aws.s3.S3FileIO
# spark.sql.catalog.streaming.warehouse = s3://<bucket-name>/
# spark.sql.catalog.streaming.s3.endpoint = http://<s3-uri>
----

NOTE: Redpanda recommends setting credentials in environment variables so Spark can securely access your Iceberg data in object storage. For example, for AWS, use `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

Using Spark SQL, you can query the Iceberg table directly by specifying the catalog name, the namespace, and the table name:

[,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM streaming.redpanda.<table-name>;
----

The Iceberg table name is the name of your Redpanda topic. Redpanda puts the Iceberg table into a namespace called `redpanda`, creating the namespace if necessary. 

The Spark engine can use the REST catalog to automatically discover the topic's Iceberg table. Depending on your processing engine, you may need to also create a table in the engine to point the data lakehouse to the table location in the catalog. For an example, see xref:manage:iceberg/redpanda-topics-iceberg-snowflake-catalog.adoc[].

== Integrate file-system based catalog (`object_storage`)

By default, Iceberg topics use the file-system based catalog (config_ref:iceberg_catalog_type,true,properties/cluster-properties[`iceberg_catalog_type`] cluster configuration set to `object_storage`). Redpanda stores the table metadata in https://iceberg.apache.org/javadoc/1.5.0/org/apache/iceberg/hadoop/HadoopCatalog.html[HadoopCatalog^] format in the same object storage bucket or container as the data files.

If using the `object_storage` catalog type, you provide the object storage URI of the table's metadata.json file to an Iceberg client so it can access the catalog and data files for your Redpanda Iceberg tables.

=== Example file-system based catalog configuration

To configure Apache Spark to use a file system-based catalog, specify at least the following properties:

[,spark]
----
spark.sql.catalog.streaming = org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkCatalog
spark.sql.catalog.streaming.type = hadoop
# URI for table metadata: AWS S3 example
spark.sql.catalog.streaming.warehouse = s3a://<bucket-name>/redpanda-iceberg-catalog
# You may need to configure additional properties based on your object storage provider.
# See https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-configuration/#spark-configuration and https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html
# For example, for AWS S3:
# spark.hadoop.fs.s3.impl = org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem
# spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.endpoint = http://<s3-uri>
# spark.sql.catalog.streaming.s3.endpoint = http://<s3-uri>
----

NOTE: Redpanda recommends setting credentials in environment variables so Spark can securely access your Iceberg data in object storage. For example, for AWS, use `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

Depending on your processing engine, you may need to also create a new table to point the data lakehouse to the table location.

=== Specify metadata location

The config_ref:iceberg_catalog_base_location,true,properties/cluster-properties[`iceberg_catalog_base_location`] property stores the base path for the file-system based catalog if using the `object_storage` catalog type. The default value is `redpanda-iceberg-catalog`. 

CAUTION: Do not change the `iceberg_catalog_base_location` value after you have enabled Iceberg integration for a topic.
