= Integrate with REST Catalogs
:description: Integrate Redpanda topics with managed Iceberg REST Catalogs.
:page-layout: index

TIP: These guides are for integrating Iceberg topics with managed REST catalogs. Integrating with a REST catalog is recommended for production deployments. If it is not possible to use a REST catalog, you can use the xref:manage:iceberg/use-iceberg-catalogs.adoc#object-storage[filesystem-based catalog]. For an example of using the filesystem-based catalog to access Iceberg topics, see the https://www.redpanda.com/blog/iceberg-topics-redpanda-cloud-byoc-setup[Getting Started with Iceberg Topics on Redpanda BYOC^] blog post. The blog post uses a Redpanda Cloud cluster, but you follow the same steps for a Self-Managed cluster.
