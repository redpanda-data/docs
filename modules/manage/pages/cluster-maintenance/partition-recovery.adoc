= Partition recovery
:description: Recover a single partition using the Admin API.

You can use the Redpanda Admin API to recover a partition that appears to be stuck (for example, does not accept writes). This can arise when the partition replicas have lost glossterm:Raft[] consensus, for instance if brokers in a Raft group fail, preventing the group from reaching a majority and electing a new leader. 

Partition recovery is carried out by promoting the best available replica to leader, allowing the partition to become available for produce and consume. Typically, Redpanda chooses the replica with the highest offset. However, this allows some potential data loss on the partition if the best available replica is out of sync, resulting in an unclean leader election. Partition recovery should only be used when brokers have failed beyond recovery to the point that the remaining replicas cannot form a majority. 

If you want to instead permanently remove failed brokers from a cluster, especially in situations where no surviving partition replicas remain, use nodewise recovery.  

== Use the Admin API to recover a partition

Make a POST request to the `/force_replicas` endpoint:

[,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:9644/v1/debug/partitions/<namespace>/<topic>/<partition>/force_replicas \
  -d '{
    [
        { "core": 0, "node_id": 0 } 
    ]
  }'
