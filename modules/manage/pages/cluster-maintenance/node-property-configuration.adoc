When you install Redpanda, a `redpanda.yaml` file is installed on each broker in `/etc/redpanda`. This file contains broker configuration properties. A broker property is one that can be set differently from broker to broker, such as `data_directory` or `node_id` (when specified). See xref:reference:node-properties.adoc[Broker Configuration Properties] for a list of broker properties, their descriptions, and their default values.

The default `redpanda.yaml` file groups broker properties into categories:

* `pandaproxy` - Properties for the Redpanda HTTP Proxy
* `redpanda` - Runtime configuration properties, such as the cluster member IP addresses and the data directory
* `rpk` - Properties that determine how `rpk` starts Redpanda
* `schema registry` - Properties related to storage, retrieval, and compatibility of the schemas

To view a sample template that includes all broker properties as they appear in the default `redpanda.yaml` file, see xref:reference:node-configuration-sample.adoc[Broker Configuration Template]. This template is annotated with descriptions of each property.

== Set broker configuration properties

The `redpanda.yaml` file rarely needs to be edited after the system is installed, but you can choose to change broker configuration property values.

CAUTION: The one broker configuration property you cannot change is the unique broker identifier: `node_id`. After a broker joins the cluster, do not change the `node_id`. You can altogether omit `node_id` from `redpanda.yaml` and have Redpanda assign it automatically. For more information, see xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/manual/production/production-deployment.adoc#configure-node-ids[Configure node IDs].

To change a broker property setting:

. Open a terminal window and navigate to the broker where you want to change a property setting.
. Go to the `/etc/redpanda` directory.
. Open the `redpanda.yaml` file.
. Change values for properties as needed.
. Save the file and close the editor.
. Restart the broker to apply the changes.

When Redpanda starts up and reads the `redpanda.yaml` file, it checks that each property setting has a valid value. If the file contains an invalid property setting, Redpanda logs an error and refuses to start.
