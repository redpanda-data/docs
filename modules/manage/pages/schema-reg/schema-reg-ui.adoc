= Use Schema Registry in Redpanda Console
:description: Perform common Schema Registry management operations in Redpanda Console.

In Redpanda Console, the **Schema Registry** tab lists registered and verified schemas, including their serialization format and versions. Select an individual schema to see which topics it applies to. 

[NOTE]
====
The Schema Registry is built into Redpanda, and you can use it with the API or Redpanda Console. This section describes Schema Registry operations available in Redpanda Console. See also:

* xref:manage:schema-reg/schema-reg-overview.adoc[]
* xref:manage:schema-reg/schema-reg-api.adoc[]
====

== Prerequisites

Redpanda Console is automatically configured with new Redpanda Cloud deployments. However, if you're running Redpanda Console with self-hosted Redpanda, you must add a valid `schemaRegistry` configuration in Redpanda Console:

.redpanda-console-config.yaml
[,yaml]
----
kafka:
  schemaRegistry:
    enabled: true
    urls: ["https://my-schema-registry.com"]
    username: console
    password: redacted # Or set using flags or env variable
  # To enable protobuf support
  protobuf:
    enabled: true
    schemaRegistry:
      enabled: true
      refreshInterval: 5m
----

== Create or edit a schema

A schema is registered in the registry with a _subject_, which is a name that is associated with the schema as it evolves. To register a schema, click **Create new schema**. 

. On the **Create schema** page, select the strategy type for how to derive the subject name. 

- **Topic** (default): The subject name is derived from the Redpanda topic name. See <<Topic strategy use case>>.
- **Record**: The subject name is derived from the Kafka record name. See <<Record strategy use case>>.
- **TopicRecord**: The subject name is derived from both topic name and record name, allowing for finer-grained schema organization. See <<TopicRecord strategy use case>>.
- **Custom**: The subject name is user-defined. 

. Select the serialization format (Avro or Protobuf) with the schema definition.

See also: xref:reference:console/record-deserialization.adoc[].

. To build more complex schema definitions, add a reference to other schemas. For example, the two `import` statements are references to the `PhoneNumber` and `Address` schemas:
+
[,json]
----
{
syntax = "proto3"; 
import "PhoneNumber.proto";
import "Address.proto"; 
message Person { 
    string name = 1;
    string email = 2;
    PhoneNumber phone  = 3; 
    repeated Address address  = 4; 
}
----

. After registering a schema, you can add a new version to it, change its compatibility, or delete it.

=== Topic strategy use case

The Topic strategy is suitable when you want to group schemas by the topics to which they are associated. Suppose you're tracking product order information in a topic named `Transactions`. When a producer sends records to the `OrderInfo` topic, you want the record names to look something like: 

- `Transactions - Record1` 
- `Transactions - Record2` 

Where `Record1` and `Record2` are unique identifiers. This is usually defined in your producer settings. Create your schema with the Topic strategy, and the subject name is always `Transactions`, with all customer transactions under the same topic. 

=== Record strategy use case

The Record strategy is most useful when you have multiple schemas within a topic and need more granular categorization that's influenced by the record name. Suppose there's an `Events` topic with event types A and B. You may want each of those event types to have their own subject, their own schemas, and their own fully-qualified record names (for example, `com.example.EventTypeA`). If each event type has its own schema with the Record strategy, then when producers send these event types to the `Events` topic, their subjects are those record names: 

- `com.example.EventTypeA`
- `com.example.EventTypeB`

The record names in the Events topic look like this: 

- `Events-com.example.EventTypeA-Record1`
- `Events-com.example.EventTypeB-Record1`
- `Events-com.example.EventTypeA-Record2`
- `Events-com.example.EventTypeB-Record2`

=== TopicRecord strategy use case

The TopicRecord strategy is suitable when you want to organize schemas based on both topics and logical record types. Suppose there's a microservices architecture where different services produce to the same topic: `SharedEvents`. Each microservice has a schema of its own for the shared events, but each schema uses the TopicRecord strategy. This results in the following subject names: 

- `SharedEvents-com.example.MicroserviceAEvent`
- `SharedEvents-com.example.MicroserviceBEvent`

The record names look like this: 

- `SharedEvents-com.example.MicroserviceAEvent-Record1`
- `SharedEvents-com.example.MicroserviceBEvent-Record1`
- `SharedEvents-com.example.MicroserviceAEvent-Record2`
- `SharedEvents-com.example.MicroserviceBEvent-Record2`

This allows for multiple schemas to govern the same shared events for different microservices, allowing granular organization. 

== Configure schema compatibility

== Delete a schema

Select a schema to soft-delete a version of it or all schemas of its subject. Schemas cannot be deleted if any other schemas reference it. A soft-deleted schema can be recovered, but a permanently-deleted schema cannot be recovered. Redpanda does not recommend permanently deleting schemas in a production environment.
