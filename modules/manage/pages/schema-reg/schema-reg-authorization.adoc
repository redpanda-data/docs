== About Schema Registry Authorization

Schema Registry Authorization allows you to control which users and applications can perform specific operations within the Redpanda Schema Registry. This ensures that only authorized entities can read, write, modify, delete, or configure schemas and their settings.

Before v25.2, Schema Registry supported authentication, but once a user was authenticated, they had full access to all Schema Registry operations, including reading, modifying, and deleting schemas and configuration both per-subject and globally.

Starting in v25.2, Schema Registry Authorization provides fine-grained access control through ACLs. You can now restrict access to specific subjects and operations.

=== How to manage Schema Registry Authorization

You can manage Schema Registry Authorization in the following ways:

- **rpk**: Use the xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security-acl-create.adoc[`rpk security acl create`] command, just like you would for other Kafka ACLs.
- **Schema Registry API**: Use the link:/api/doc/schema-registry/operation/operation-get_security_acls[Redpanda Schema Registry API] endpoints.
ifndef::env-cloud[]
- **{ui}**: After enabling Schema Registry Authorization for your cluster, you can use {ui} to manage Schema Registry ACLs. See xref:manage:security/authorization/acl.adoc[]. 
endif::[]
ifdef::env-cloud[]
- **{ui}**: After enabling Schema Registry Authorization for your cluster, you can use {ui} to manage Schema Registry ACLs. See xref:security:/authorization/acl.adoc[]. 
endif::[]

=== Schema Registry ACL resource types

Schema Registry Authorization introduces two new ACL resource types in addition to the standard Kafka ACL resources (`topic`, `group`, `cluster`, and `transactional_id`):

* `registry`: Controls whether or not to grant ACL access to global, or top-level Schema Registry operations. Specify using the flag `registry-global`.
* `subject`: Controls ACL access for specific Schema Registry subjects. Specify using the flag `registry-subject`.

== Supported operations

Redpanda Schema Registry ACLs support the following specific subset of Schema Registry endpoints and operations:

[NOTE]
====
Not all Kafka operations are supported when using Redpanda Schema Registry ACLs.

For additional guidance on these operations, see the link:/api/doc/schema-registry/operation/operation-get_security_acls[Redpanda Schema Registry API].

=== Operation definitions

You can use the following operations to control access to Schema Registry resources:

* **`read`**: Allows user to read schemas and their content. Required for consuming messages that use Schema Registry, fetching specific schema versions, and reading schema content by ID.
* **`write`**: Allows user to register new schemas and schema versions. Required for producing messages with new schemas and updating existing subjects with new schema versions.
* **`delete`**: Allows user to delete schema versions and subjects. Required for cleanup operations and removing deprecated schemas.
* **`describe`**: Allows user to list and describe Schema Registry resources. Required for discovering available subjects, listing schema versions, and viewing metadata.
* **`describe_configs`**: Allows user to read configuration settings. Required for viewing compatibility settings, reading modes (IMPORT/READWRITE), and checking global or per-subject configurations.
* **`alter_configs`**: Allows user to modify configuration settings. Required for changing compatibility levels, setting IMPORT mode for migrations, and updating global or per-subject configurations.

=== Common use cases

The following examples show which operations are required for common Schema Registry tasks:

==== Schema Registry migration

When migrating schemas between clusters, you must have **different ACLs for source and target clusters**.

**Source cluster (read-only):**

[,bash]
----
# Read schemas from source Schema Registry
rpk security acl create \
  --allow-principal User:migrator-user \
  --operation read,describe \
  --registry-global \
  --brokers <source-brokers>
----

This grants:

* `read` - Read schemas by ID from source
* `describe` - List all subjects in source

[NOTE]
====
The `describe_configs` operation is required to read Schema Registry configuration settings, including compatibility modes and IMPORT mode status.
====

**Target cluster (read-write):**

[,bash]
----
# Write schemas to target Schema Registry and manage IMPORT mode
rpk security acl create \
  --allow-principal User:migrator-user \
  --operation write,describe,alter_configs,describe_configs \
  --registry-global \
  --brokers <target-brokers>
----

This grants:

* `write` - Register schemas in target with preserved IDs
* `describe` - List all subjects in target
* `alter_configs` - Set IMPORT mode on target Schema Registry
* `describe_configs` - Read compatibility settings and mode

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Schema Registry ACLs are only for Schema Registry operations.** For complete data migration, you must also use Kafka ACLs:

* **Topics:** READ (source), WRITE/CREATE/DESCRIBE/ALTER (target)
* **Consumer groups:** READ (source), CREATE/READ (target)
* **Cluster:** DESCRIBE (both), CREATE (target)

See xref:manage:security/authorization/acl.adoc[Configure Access Control Lists] for Kafka ACL configuration.
====

[NOTE]
====
The target Schema Registry must be in IMPORT mode to preserve schema IDs during migration. Only superusers or principals with `alter_configs` permission on the `registry` resource can change the global mode.
ifndef::env-cloud[]
See xref:manage:schema-reg/schema-reg-api.adoc#set-global-mode[Set global mode].
endif::[]
ifdef::env-cloud[]
See xref:schema-reg:schema-reg-api.adoc#set-global-mode[Set global mode].
endif::[]
====

==== Complete migration setup workflow

For a complete migration setup, follow this workflow:

1. **Bootstrap superusers** - Configure superusers using `.bootstrap.yaml` before enabling authentication
2. **Create migration user** - Create dedicated migration user with minimal required permissions
3. **Configure Schema Registry ACLs** - Grant read access on source, read-write access on target
4. **Configure Kafka ACLs** - Grant topic read/write, consumer group, and cluster permissions
5. **Enable SASL authentication** - Enable SASL/SCRAM-SHA-256 on both clusters
6. **Enable ACL authorization** - Enable `kafka_enable_authorization` and `schema_registry_enable_authorization`
7. **Set target to IMPORT mode** - Enable IMPORT mode on target Schema Registry
8. **Start migration** - Begin data and schema migration
9. **Verify ACLs** - Test that permissions work correctly and restrictions are enforced
10. **Complete migration** - Disable IMPORT mode after migration completes

For a complete working example with Docker Compose, see the https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-labs/tree/main/docker-compose/redpanda-migrator-demo[Redpanda Migrator Demo].

[NOTE]
====
**Schema Registry Internal Client Authentication:** When SASL authentication is enabled on your Kafka cluster, the Schema Registry's internal Kafka client must also be configured with SASL credentials. Configure these using node-level properties:

[,bash]
----
--set schema_registry_client.scram_username=<username>
--set schema_registry_client.scram_password=<password>
--set schema_registry_client.sasl_mechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256
----

Without these credentials, Schema Registry operations that interact with Kafka (like storing schema data) will fail with "broker_not_available" errors.
====

==== Read-only access for consumers

Applications that only consume messages with schemas require:

[,bash]
----
# For consuming with schema validation
rpk security acl create \
  --allow-principal consumer-app \
  --operation read \
  --registry-subject "orders-*" \
  --resource-pattern-type prefixed
----

This allows:

* Reading schema content by ID (embedded in messages)
* Viewing specific schema versions

This does _not_ allow listing all subjects or modifying schemas.

==== Producer access

Applications that produce messages with schemas require:

[,bash]
----
# For producing with new schemas
rpk security acl create \
  --allow-principal producer-app \
  --operation read,write,describe \
  --registry-subject "orders-*" \
  --resource-pattern-type prefixed
----

This allows:

* Checking if schemas already exist (`describe`)
* Reading existing schema versions (`read`)
* Registering new schema versions (`write`)

==== Schema administrator access

Schema administrators who manage compatibility and cleanup require:

[,bash]
----
# For full schema management
rpk security acl create \
  --allow-principal schema-admin \
  --operation all \
  --registry-global
----

This grants all operations, including:

* Managing compatibility settings
* Deleting deprecated schemas
* Viewing and modifying configurations
* Listing all subjects and schemas

=== Pattern-based ACLs for Schema Registry

When using subject name patterns (like `orders-*`), always specify `--resource-pattern-type prefixed`:

[,bash]
----
# Correct - matches all subjects starting with "orders-"
rpk security acl create \
  --allow-principal User:app \
  --operation read \
  --registry-subject "orders-" \
  --resource-pattern-type prefixed

# Incorrect - treats "orders-*" as literal subject name
rpk security acl create \
  --allow-principal User:app \
  --operation read \
  --registry-subject "orders-*"
----

Pattern types:

* **`prefixed`** - Matches subjects starting with the specified string (for example, `orders-` matches `orders-value`, `orders-key`)
* **`literal`** - Matches exact subject name only (default if not specified)

[TIP]
====
Redpanda recommends using the topic naming strategy where subjects follow the pattern `<topicName>-key` or `<topicName>-value`. With this strategy, you can use a single prefixed ACL to grant access to both key and value subjects for a topic.

Example: `--registry-subject "orders-" --resource-pattern-type prefixed` grants access to both `orders-key` and `orders-value` subjects.
====

== Enable Schema Registry Authorization

=== Prerequisites

Before you can enable Schema Registry Authorization, you must have:

ifndef::env-cloud[]
* A valid Redpanda Enterprise license.
endif::[]

ifdef::env-cloud[]
* `rpk` v25.2+ installed. For installation instructions, see xref:manage:rpk/rpk-install.adoc[rpk installation].
endif::[]

ifndef::env-cloud[]
* `rpk` v25.2+ installed. For installation instructions, see xref:get-started:rpk-install.adoc[rpk installation].
endif::[]

ifndef::env-cloud[]
* Authentication enabled using `schema_registry_api.authn_method`, which specifies how clients must authenticate when accessing the Schema Registry API. See xref:reference:properties/broker-properties.adoc#schema-registry[Schema Registry broker properties].
endif::[]

ifndef::env-cloud[]
* If you have listeners configured for Schema Registry, ensure you xref:manage:security/authentication.adoc#basic-authentication[configure authentication] for them and that your configuration points to the correct Schema Registry address (correct scheme, host, and port) for the same cluster you are targeting with your Kafka brokers.
endif::[]

* Cluster administrator permissions to modify cluster configurations.
  For example, to enable management of Schema Registry ACLs by the principal `schema_registry_admin`, run:

  [,bash]
  ----
  rpk security acl create --allow-principal schema_registry_admin --cluster --operation alter
  ----

=== Enable authorization

To enable Schema Registry Authorization for your cluster, run:

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster config set schema_registry_enable_authorization true
----

For details, see xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#schema_registry_enable_authorization[`schema_registry_enable_authorization`].

== Create and manage Schema Registry ACLs

This section shows you how to create and manage ACLs for Schema Registry resources.

=== Create an ACL for a topic and Schema Registry subject

This example creates an ACL that allows the principal `panda` to read from both the topic `bar` and the Schema Registry subject `bar-value`. This pattern is common when you want to give a user or application access to both the Kafka topic and its associated schema.

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create --allow-principal panda --operation read --topic bar --registry-subject bar-value

PRINCIPAL   HOST  RESOURCE-TYPE  RESOURCE-NAME  RESOURCE-PATTERN-TYPE  OPERATION  PERMISSION  ERROR
User:panda  *     SUBJECT        bar-value      LITERAL                READ       ALLOW
User:panda  *     TOPIC          bar            LITERAL                READ       ALLOW

----

=== Create an ACL for global Schema Registry access

This example grants the user `jane` global read and write access to the Schema Registry, plus read and write access to the topic `private`. The `--registry-global` flag creates ACLs for all <<supported-operations,global Schema Registry operations>>.

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create --allow-principal jane --operation read,write --topic private --registry-global
PRINCIPAL  HOST  RESOURCE-TYPE  RESOURCE-NAME  RESOURCE-PATTERN-TYPE  OPERATION  PERMISSION  ERROR
User:jane  *     REGISTRY                      LITERAL                READ       ALLOW
User:jane  *     REGISTRY                      LITERAL                WRITE      ALLOW
User:jane  *     TOPIC          private        LITERAL                READ       ALLOW
User:jane  *     TOPIC          private        LITERAL                WRITE      ALLOW
----

User `jane` now has global `read` and `write` access to the Schema Registry and to the topic `private`.

=== Create a role with Schema Registry ACLs

ifdef::env-cloud[]
You can combine Schema Registry ACLs with xref:security:authorization/rbac/rbac_dp.adoc[role-based access control (RBAC)] to create reusable roles. This approach simplifies permission management when you need to assign the same set of permissions to multiple users.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
You can combine Schema Registry ACLs with xref:manage:security/authorization/rbac.adoc[role-based access control (RBAC)] to create reusable roles. This approach simplifies permission management when you need to assign the same set of permissions to multiple users.
endif::[]

This example creates a role called `SoftwareEng` and assigns it ACLs for both topic and Schema Registry access:

ifndef::env-cloud[]
[NOTE]
====
Redpanda recommends using the topic naming strategy for Schema Registry subjects, where subjects follow the pattern `<topicName>-key` or `<topicName>-value`. For details, see xref:manage:schema-reg/schema-id-validation.adoc#set-subject-name-strategy-per-topic[Set subject name strategy per topic].
====
endif::[]

[,bash]
----
# Create the role
rpk security role create SoftwareEng

# Create ACLs for the role
rpk security acl create \
  --operation read,write \
  --topic private \
  --registry-subject private-key,private-value \
  --allow-role SoftwareEng

# You can add more ACLs to this role later
rpk security acl create --allow-role "SoftwareEng" [additional-acl-flags]
----

After creating the role, assign it to users:

[,bash]
----

rpk security role assign SoftwareEng --principal User:john,User:jane
Successfully assigned role "SoftwareEng" to
NAME  PRINCIPAL-TYPE
john  User
jane  User
----

=== Troubleshooting ACL creation

When creating ACLs that include Schema Registry subjects, you might encounter errors if the subject doesn't exist or if there are configuration issues.

==== Subject not found

Sometimes an ACL for a Kafka topic is created successfully, but the Schema Registry subject ACL fails:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create --allow-principal alice --operation read --topic bar --registry-subject bar-value

PRINCIPAL   HOST  RESOURCE-TYPE  RESOURCE-NAME  RESOURCE-PATTERN-TYPE  OPERATION  PERMISSION  ERROR
User:alice  *     SUBJECT        bar-value      LITERAL                READ       ALLOW       Not found
User:alice  *     TOPIC          bar            LITERAL                READ       ALLOW
----

In this example, the ACL for topic `bar` was created successfully, but the ACL for Schema Registry subject `bar-value` failed with a "Not found" error.

**Common causes:**

* Incorrect Schema Registry URL configuration
* Using the incorrect version of Redpanda

==== Debugging with verbose output

To get more detailed information about ACL creation failures, use the `-v` flag for verbose logging.

In this case, the user gets a `Not found` error after attempting to create two ACLs, one for the subject and one for the topic:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create --allow-principal alice --operation read --topic bar --registry-subject bar-value -v
12:17:33.911 DEBUG opening connection to broker {"addr": "127.0.0.1:9092", "broker": "seed_0"}

* You're on Redpanda v25.2+.
* `schema_registry_enable_authorization` is set to `true`.
* Your rpk Schema Registry URL points to the correct host/scheme/port.
Upgrade if needed and correct configuration before retrying.

==== Inconsistent listener configuration

This error occurs when the user tries to create an ACL for a principal:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create --allow-principal "superuser" --operation "all" --registry-global -v
13:07:02.810  DEBUG  opening connection to broker  {"addr": "seed-036d6a67.d2hiu9c8ljef72usuu20.fmc.prd.cloud.redpanda.com:9092", "broker": "seed_0"}

User:superuser  *     REGISTRY                      LITERAL                ALL        ALLOW       unable to POST "https://127.0.0.1:8080/security/acls": Post "https://127.0.0.1:8080/security/acls": http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client
----

When using Schema Registry Authorization, ensure that your Kafka brokers and Schema Registry address target the same cluster and that the Schema Registry address uses the correct scheme/host/port. In the example above, `rpk` communicates with a remote broker (`...:9092`) but posts to a local Schema Registry address over HTTPS (`https://127.0.0.1:8080/security/acls`), while the local Schema Registry appears to be HTTP-only. To align them:
* Set the correct Schema Registry address (host and scheme) for the target cluster.
* Ensure TLS settings match the Schema Registry endpoint (HTTP vs HTTPS).
* Avoid mixing remote broker addresses with a local Schema Registry address unless it is intentional and properly configured.

See xref:reference:rpk/rpk-registry/rpk-registry.adoc[rpk registry] for Schema Registry configuration commands.

==== Resource names do not appear

The following output appears to suggest that there are missing resource names for the registry resource types:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create --allow-principal jane --operation read,write --topic private --registry-global
PRINCIPAL  HOST  RESOURCE-TYPE  RESOURCE-NAME  RESOURCE-PATTERN-TYPE  OPERATION  PERMISSION  ERROR
User:jane  *     REGISTRY                      LITERAL                READ       ALLOW
User:jane  *     REGISTRY                      LITERAL                WRITE      ALLOW
User:jane  *     TOPIC          private        LITERAL                READ       ALLOW
User:jane  *     TOPIC          private        LITERAL                WRITE      ALLOW
----

When using the `--registry-global` option, be aware that `REGISTRY` resource types are global and apply to all of Schema Registry. They do not have a resource name because they are not tied to a specific resource. There are no resource names missing here.

==== Schema Registry "broker_not_available" errors

If Schema Registry operations fail with `broker_not_available` errors after enabling SASL:

[,bash]
----
{"error_code":50302,"message":"{ node: -1 }, { error_code: broker_not_available [8] }"}
----

**Cause:** The Schema Registry's internal Kafka client is not configured with SASL credentials.

**Solution:** Configure the Schema Registry client credentials:

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster config set schema_registry_client.scram_username <username>
rpk cluster config set schema_registry_client.scram_password <password>
rpk cluster config set schema_registry_client.sasl_mechanism SCRAM-SHA-256
----

Then restart the Schema Registry service.

==== Pattern-based ACL not working

If a pattern-based ACL (like `orders-*`) is not matching expected subjects:

**Cause:** Missing `--resource-pattern-type prefixed` flag.

**Solution:** Recreate the ACL with the correct pattern type:

[,bash]
----
# Delete incorrect ACL
rpk security acl delete \
  --allow-principal User:app \
  --operation read \
  --registry-subject "orders-*"

# Create correct ACL with pattern type
rpk security acl create \
  --allow-principal User:app \
  --operation read \
  --registry-subject "orders-" \
  --resource-pattern-type prefixed
----

Note: Pattern matching uses the string without the asterisk when using `prefixed` type.
