:description: Learn how to set up and manage Schema Registry Authorization using ACL definitions that control user access to specific Schema Registry operations.
// tag::single-source[]

Schema Registry Authorization enables fine-grained restriction of operations to Schema Registry resources by user or role through access control lists (ACLs).

== About Schema Registry Authorization

Schema Registry Authorization allows you to control which users and applications can perform specific operations within the Redpanda Schema Registry. This ensures that only authorized entities can read, write, modify, delete, or configure schemas and their settings.

Before v25.2, Schema Registry supported authentication, but once a user was authenticated, they had full access to all Schema Registry operations, including reading, modifying, and deleting schemas and configuration both per-subject and globally.

Starting in v25.2, Schema Registry Authorization provides fine-grained access control through ACLs. You can now restrict access to specific subjects and operations.

=== How to manage Schema Registry Authorization

You can manage Schema Registry Authorization in two ways:

- **Using rpk**: Use the xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security-acl-create.adoc[`rpk security acl create`] command, just like you would for other Kafka ACLs.
- **Using the API**: Use the xref:api:ROOT:schema-registry-api.adoc#get-/security/acls[Redpanda Schema Registry API] endpoints.

=== Schema Registry ACL resource types

Schema Registry Authorization introduces two new ACL resource types in addition to the standard Kafka ACL resources (`topic`, `group`, `cluster`, and `transactional_id`):

* `registry`: Controls whether or not to grant ACL access to global, or top-level Schema Registry operations. Specify using the flag `registry-global`.
* `subject`: Controls ACL access for specific Schema Registry subjects. Specify using the flag `registry-subject`.

== Supported operations

Redpanda Schema Registry ACLs support the following specific subset of Schema Registry endpoints and operations:

[NOTE]
====
Not all Kafka operations are supported when using Redpanda Schema Registry ACLs.

== Enable Schema Registry Authorization

=== Prerequisites

Before you can enable Schema Registry Authorization, you must have:

* A valid Redpanda Enterprise license
* `rpk` v25.2+
* Cluster administrator permissions to modify cluster configuration

=== Enable authorization

To enable Schema Registry Authorization for your cluster, run:

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster config set schema_registry_enable_authorization true
----

To enable management of Schema Registry ACLs by the principal `schema_registry_admin`, run:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create --allow-principal schema_registry_admin --cluster --operation alter
----

For details, see xref:reference:properties/cluster-properties.adoc#schema_registry_enable_authorization[`schema_registry_enable_authorization`].

== Create and manage Schema Registry ACLs

This section shows you how to create and manage ACLs for Schema Registry resources.

=== Create an ACL for a topic and Schema Registry subject

This example creates an ACL that allows the principal `panda` to read from both the topic `bar` and the Schema Registry subject `bar-value`. This pattern is common when you want to give a user or application access to both the Kafka topic and its associated schema.

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create --allow-principal panda --operation read --topic bar --registry-subject bar-value

PRINCIPAL   HOST  RESOURCE-TYPE  RESOURCE-NAME  RESOURCE-PATTERN-TYPE  OPERATION  PERMISSION  ERROR
User:panda  *     SUBJECT        bar-value      LITERAL                READ       ALLOW
User:panda  *     TOPIC          bar            LITERAL                READ       ALLOW

----

=== Create an ACL for global Schema Registry access

This example grants the user `jane` global read and write access to the Schema Registry, plus read and write access to the topic `private`. The `--registry-global` flag creates ACLs for all <<supported-operations,global Schema Registry operations>>.

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create --allow-principal jane --operation read,write --topic private --registry-global
PRINCIPAL  HOST  RESOURCE-TYPE  RESOURCE-NAME  RESOURCE-PATTERN-TYPE  OPERATION  PERMISSION  ERROR
User:jane  *     REGISTRY                      LITERAL                READ       ALLOW
User:jane  *     REGISTRY                      LITERAL                WRITE      ALLOW
User:jane  *     TOPIC          private        LITERAL                READ       ALLOW
User:jane  *     TOPIC          private        LITERAL                WRITE      ALLOW
----

User `jane` now has global `read` and `write` access to the Schema Registry and to the topic `private`.

=== Create a role with Schema Registry ACLs

You can combine Schema Registry ACLs with xref:manage:security/authorization/rbac.adoc[role-based access control (RBAC)] to create reusable roles. This approach simplifies permission management when you need to assign the same set of permissions to multiple users.

This example creates a role called `SoftwareEng` and assigns it ACLs for both topic and Schema Registry access:

[NOTE]
====
Redpanda recommends using the topic naming strategy for Schema Registry subjects, where subjects follow the pattern `<topicName>-key` or `<topicName>-value`. For details, see xref:manage:schema-reg/schema-id-validation.adoc#set-subject-name-strategy-per-topic[Set subject name strategy per topic].
====

[,bash]
----
# Create the role
rpk security role create SoftwareEng

# Create ACLs for the role
rpk security acl create \
  --operation read,write \
  --topic private \
  --registry-subject private-key,private-value \
  --allow-role SoftwareEng

# You can add more ACLs to this role later
rpk security acl create --allow-role "RedpandaRole:SoftwareEng" [additional-acl-flags]
----

After creating the role, assign it to users:

[,bash]
----

rpk security role assign SoftwareEng --principal User:john,User:jane
Successfully assigned role "SoftwareEng" to
NAME  PRINCIPAL-TYPE
john  User
jane  User
----

=== Troubleshooting ACL creation

When creating ACLs that include Schema Registry subjects, you might encounter errors if the subject doesn't exist or if there are configuration issues.

==== Common error: Subject not found

Sometimes an ACL for a Kafka topic is created successfully, but the Schema Registry subject ACL fails:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create --allow-principal alice --operation read --topic bar --registry-subject bar-value

PRINCIPAL   HOST  RESOURCE-TYPE  RESOURCE-NAME  RESOURCE-PATTERN-TYPE  OPERATION  PERMISSION  ERROR
User:alice  *     SUBJECT        bar-value      LITERAL                READ       ALLOW       Not found
User:alice  *     TOPIC          bar            LITERAL                READ       ALLOW
----

In this example, the ACL for topic `bar` was created successfully, but the ACL for Schema Registry subject `bar-value` failed with a "Not found" error.

**Common causes:**

* Incorrect Schema Registry URL configuration
* Using the incorrect version of Redpanda

==== Debugging with verbose output

To get more detailed information about ACL creation failures, use the `-v` flag for verbose logging.

In this case, the user gets a `Not found` error after attempting to create two ACLs, one for the subject and one for the topic:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create --allow-principal alice --operation read --topic bar --registry-subject bar-value -v

----

The `Not found` error occurs in the request: `12:17:33.935 DEBUG sending request {"method": "POST", "URL: "http://127.0.0.1:8081/security/acls", "has_bearer": false, 
"has_basic_auth": false}`, meaning that the endpoint is not available (because you are using an older Redpanda version). You must upgrade to the current version of Redpanda.

This next error occurs when the user tries to create two ACLs, one for a topic and one for a registry-subject:

[bash]
----

----

The `Invalid license: not present` error indicates that the user is trying to create an ACL for a resource that requires a license, but no license is present. See xref:get-started/licensing/overview.adoc[Licensing overview] for details on how to obtain a license.
