Understanding the unique aspects of Redpanda's architecture and data path can improve your performance, debugging, and tuning skills:

* Redpanda replicates partitions across brokers in a cluster by using the <Link to={props.frontmatter && props.frontmatter.linkRoot + 'get-started/architecture#raft-consensus-algorithm'}>Raft consensus protocol</Link>, where each partition is a Raft consensus group. A message written from the Kafka API flows down to the Raft implementation layer that eventually directs it to a broker to be stored. Metrics about the Raft layer can reveal the health of partitions and data flowing within Redpanda.
* Redpanda is designed with a <Link to={props.frontmatter && props.frontmatter.linkRoot + 'get-started/architecture#thread-per-core-model'}>thread-per-core model</Link> that it implements with the Seastar library. With each application thread pinned to a CPU core, when observing or analyzing the behavior of a specific application, monitor the relevant metrics with the label for the specific CPU core ("shard"), if available.
