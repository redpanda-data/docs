Remote read fetches data from cloud storage using the Kafka API. Use remote read in conjunction with remote write to enable Tiered Storage. If you use remote read without remote write, there is nothing for Redpanda to read.
:description: 

In general, when data is evicted locally, it is no longer available. If the consumer starts consuming the partition from the beginning, the first offset is the smallest offset available locally. However, if Tiered Storage is enabled with the `redpanda.remote.read` and `redpanda.remote.write` flags, the data is always uploaded to remote storage before it's deleted. This guarantees that the data is always available either locally or remotely.

When data is available remotely and Tiered Storage is enabled, the client can start consuming data, even if the data is no longer stored locally.

To create a topic with remote read enabled:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic create <topic_name> -c -c redpanda.remote.read=true
----

To enable remote read on an existing topic:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic alter-config <topic_name> --set redpanda.remote.read=true
----
