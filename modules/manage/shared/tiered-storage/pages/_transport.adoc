Tiered Storage creates a connection pool for each CPU that limits simultaneous connections to the object storage provider. It also uses persistent HTTP connections with a configurable maximum idle time. A custom S3 client is used to send and receive data.

For normal usage, you do not need to configure the transport properties. The Redpanda defaults are sufficient, and the certificates used to connect to the object storage client are available through public key infrastructure. Redpanda detects the location of the CA certificates automatically.

Redpanda uses the following properties to configure transport.

{props.frontmatter && props.frontmatter.deployment=='manual' && 'Edit them with the `rpk cluster config edit` command.'}

| Property | Description

| <ClusterProperty name="cloud_storage_max_connections" frontmatter={props.frontmatter}/>
| The maximum number of connections to object storage on a broker for each CPU. Remote read and remote write share the same pool of connections. This means that if a connection is used to upload a segment, it cannot be used to download another segment. If this value is too small, some workloads might starve for connections, which results in delayed uploads and downloads. If this value is too large, Redpanda tries to upload a lot of files at the same time and might overwhelm the system. Default is 20.

| <TunableClusterProperty name="cloud_storage_segment_upload_timeout_ms" frontmatter={props.frontmatter}/>
| Timeout for segment upload. Redpanda retries the upload after the timeout. Default is 30000 ms.

| <TunableClusterProperty name="cloud_storage_manifest_upload_timeout_ms" frontmatter={props.frontmatter}/>
| Timeout for manifest upload. Redpanda retries the upload after the timeout. Default is 10000 ms.

| <TunableClusterProperty name="cloud_storage_max_connection_idle_time_ms" frontmatter={props.frontmatter}/>
| The maximum idle time for persistent HTTP connections. This differs depending on the object storage provider. Default is 5000 ms, which is sufficient for most providers.

| <TunableClusterProperty name="cloud_storage_segment_max_upload_interval_sec" frontmatter={props.frontmatter}/>
| The number of seconds for idle timeout. If this property is empty, Redpanda uploads metadata to the object storage, but the segment is not uploaded until it reaches the `segment.bytes` size. By default, the property is empty.

| <ClusterProperty name="cloud_storage_trust_file" frontmatter={props.frontmatter}/>
| The public certificate used to validate the TLS connection to object storage. If this is empty, Redpanda uses your operating system's CA cert pool.
