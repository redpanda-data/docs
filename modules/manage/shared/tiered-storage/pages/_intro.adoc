Tiered Storage helps to lower storage costs by offloading log segments to cloud storage. You can specify the amount of storage you want to retain in local storage. You don't need to specify which log segments you want to move, because Redpanda moves them automatically based on cluster-level configuration properties. Tiered Storage indexes where data is offloaded, so it can retrieve the data when you need it.

Redpanda natively supports Tiered Storage with Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage (GCS). Migrating topics from one cloud provider to another is not supported.

The following image illustrates the Tiered Storage architecture: remote write uploads data from Redpanda to cloud storage, and remote read fetches data from cloud storage to Redpanda.

Do not use Tiered Storage with <Link to={props.frontmatter && props.frontmatter.linkRoot + 'labs/data-transform'}>data transforms</Link>, which is a lab feature in technical preview. Lab features are not supported for production usage.
