To benefit from Redpanda's new features and enhancements, upgrade to the latest version. Redpanda recommends that you perform a rolling upgrade on production clusters, which requires all brokers to be placed into maintenance mode and restarted separately, one after the other.

Redpanda platform version numbers follow the convention AB.C.D, where AB is the two digit year, C is the feature release, and D is the patch release. For example, version 22.3.1 indicates the first patch release on the third feature release of the year 2022. Patch releases include bug fixes and minor improvements, with no change to user-facing behavior. New and enhanced features are documented with each feature release.+++<ImportantUpgradeNote>++++++</ImportantUpgradeNote>+++

== Prerequisites

* A running Redpanda cluster.
* https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/[jq] for listing available versions.
* An understanding of the <<impact-of-broker-restarts,impact of broker restarts>> on clients, node CPU, and any alerting systems you use.

== Find a new version

Before you upgrade, find out which Redpanda version you are currently running, whether you can upgrade straight to the new version, and what's changed since your original version. To find your current version, run:

////
[tabs]
=====
Linux::
+
--
[,bash]
----
rpk redpanda admin brokers list
----

For all available flags, see the xref:reference:rpk:rpk-redpanda:rpk-redpanda-admin-brokers-list.adoc[`rpk redpanda admin brokers list` command reference].

--
Docker::
+
--
:::caution
Running Redpanda directly on Docker is not supported for production usage. This platform should only be used for testing.
:::

[,bash]
----
docker exec -it <container_name><container_tag> rpk version
----

Remember to replace the variables `<container_name>` and `<container_tag>`. The container tag determines which version of `rpk` to use. The release process bundles `rpk` and `Redpanda` into the same container tag with the same version.

--
macOS::
+
--
[,bash]
----
brew list --versions | grep redpanda
----

--
=====
////

////
.Example output
[%collapsible]
====
```bash
v22.3.11 (rev 9eefb90)

```
====
////

:::note
If your current version is more than one feature release behind the latest Redpanda version, you must first upgrade to an intermediate version. To list all available versions:

[,bash]
----
curl -s 'https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/redpandadata/redpanda/tags/?ordering=last_updated&page=1&page_size=50' | jq -r '.results[].name'
----

== Impact of broker restarts+++<ImpactOfRestarts>++++++</ImpactOfRestarts>+++

== Perform a rolling upgrade

A rolling upgrade involves putting a broker into xref::node-management.adoc[maintenance mode], upgrading the broker, taking the broker out of maintenance mode, and then repeating the process on the next broker in the cluster. Placing brokers into maintenance mode ensures a smooth upgrade of your cluster while reducing the risk of interruption or degradation in service.

When a broker is placed into maintenance mode, it reassigns its partition leadership to other brokers for all topics that have a replication factor greater than one. Reassigning partition leadership involves _draining_ leadership from the broker and _transferring_ that leadership to another broker. If you have topics with `replication.factor=1`, and if you have sufficient disk space, Redpanda recommends temporarily increasing the replication factor. This can help limit outages for these topics during the rolling upgrade. Do this before the upgrade to make sure there's time for the data to replicate to other brokers. For more information, see xref:data-migration:.adoc#change-topic-replication-factor[Change topic replication factor].

To ensure that all brokers are active before upgrading, run:

[,bash]
----
rpk redpanda admin brokers list
----

All brokers should show `active` for `MEMBERSHIP-STATUS` and `true` for `IS-ALIVE`:

////
.Example output
[%collapsible]
====
```
NODE-ID  NUM-CORES  MEMBERSHIP-STATUS  IS-ALIVE  BROKER-VERSION
0        1          active             true      v22.3.11
1        1          active             true      v22.3.11
2        1          active             true      v22.3.11
```
====
////

New features in a version are enabled after all brokers in the cluster are upgraded. If problems occur, the upgrade is not committed.

:::note
Redpanda started supporting xref:develop:consume-data:consumer-offsets.adoc[consumer offsets] in version 22.1. When upgrading from version 21.11 to 22.1, after all brokers are upgraded, Redpanda starts to migrate consumer group topics to `__consumer_offsets`. This takes some time, depending on the data size. Until it finishes, all consumer group-related operations (consume, offset commit, coordinator election) are blocked. The migration to consumer offsets is complete when you see `consumer offset feature enabled` in all brokers.

=== Enable maintenance mode

. Check that all brokers are healthy:
+
[,bash]
----
 rpk cluster health
----+++<details>++++++<summary>+++Expected output+++</summary>+++ ```bash \{3} CLUSTER HEALTH OVERVIEW ======================= Healthy: true Controller ID: 0 All nodes: [0 1 2] Nodes down: [] Leaderless partitions: [] Under-replicated partitions: [] ```+++</details>+++

. Select a broker that has not been upgraded yet and place it into maintenance mode:
+
[,bash]
----
 rpk cluster maintenance enable <node-id> --wait
----
+
The --wait option tells the command to wait until a given broker, 0 in this example, finishes draining all partitions it originally served. After the partition draining completes, the command completes.+++<details>++++++<summary>+++Expected output+++</summary>+++ ``` Successfully enabled maintenance mode for node 0 Waiting for node to drain\...

. Verify that the broker is in maintenance mode:
+
```bash \{2}
 rpk cluster maintenance status
+
----

 <details>
 <summary>

 </summary>

 ```bash {2}

----
+
</details>

. Validate again the health of the cluster:
+
[,bash]
----
 rpk cluster health
----+++<details>++++++<summary>+++Expected output+++</summary>+++ ```bash \{3} CLUSTER HEALTH OVERVIEW ======================= Healthy: true Controller ID: 0 All nodes: [0 1 2] Nodes down: [] Leaderless partitions: [] Under-replicated partitions: [] ```+++</details>+++
+
:::note
 You can also evaluate xref::monitoring.adoc[external metrics] to determine cluster health. If the cluster has any issues, take the broker out of maintenance mode by running the following command before proceeding with other operations, such as decommissioning or retrying the rolling upgrade:
+
[,bash]
----
 rpk cluster maintenance disable <node-id>
----
+
