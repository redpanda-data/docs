:term-name: replication factor
:hover-text: The number of copies of partitions in a cluster. This is set to 3 in Redpanda Cloud deployments and 1 (no replication) in Self-Managed deployments. A replication factor greater than 1 ensures that each partition has a copy of its data on at least one other broker. One replica acts as the leader, and the other replicas are followers.
