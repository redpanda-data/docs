The log is Redpanda's core storage abstraction for event streams. At the conceptual level, topics represent replayable logs. Physically, each partition is implemented as a log file on disk, divided into segments. Redpanda uses the Raft consensus algorithm to coordinate writing data to log files and replicate them across brokers for fault tolerance.
