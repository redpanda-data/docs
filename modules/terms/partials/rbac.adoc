Role-based access control (RBAC) lets you assign users access to specific resources. 

You can use RBAC in Redpanda Cloud's control plane to manage access to organization-level resources, like clusters, resource groups, and networks. You can use RBAC in the data plane to configure cluster-level permissions for provisioned users at scale.
