=== topic partition
:term-name: topic partition
:hover-text: A topic may be partitioned through multiple brokers. A "topic partition" represents this logical separation on Redpanda. It is managed by Raft, applying voting mechanisms such as Round Robin. In contrast, other Kafka applications use ZooKeeper to manage their partitions. In Redpanda this is managed natively by Raft.
