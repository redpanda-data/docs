=== topic partition
:term-name: topic partition
:hover-text: A topic may be partitioned through multiple brokers. A "topic partition" represents this logical separation in Redpanda, which is managed natively by Raft and applies voting mechanisms such as Round Robin. In contrast, other Kafka applications use ZooKeeper to manage their partitions.
