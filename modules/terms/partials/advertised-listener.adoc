=== advertised listener
:term-name: advertised listener
:hover-text: The address a Redpanda broker broadcasts to producers, consumers, and other brokers. It specifies the hostname and port for connections to different listeners. Clients and other brokers use advertised listeners to connect to services such as the Admin API, Kafka API, and HTTP Proxy API. The advertised address might differ from the listener address in scenarios where brokers are behind a NAT, in a Docker container, or in Kubernetes. Advertised addresses ensure clients can reach the Redpanda brokers even in complex network setups.
