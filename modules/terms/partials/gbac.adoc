:hover-text: Group-based access control extends RBAC by letting you assign permissions to OIDC groups so that users inherit access based on their identity provider group membership.
:category: Redpanda security

GBAC builds on xref:ROOT:manage:security/authorization/rbac.adoc[role-based access control (RBAC)] to simplify permission management at scale. Instead of assigning roles or ACLs to individual users, you assign them to OIDC groups managed by your identity provider. Users inherit permissions from all groups reported in their OIDC token claims.

For more information, see xref:ROOT:manage:security/authorization/gbac.adoc[].
