:term-name: GBAC
:hover-text: Group-based access control lets you assign permissions to OIDC groups so that users inherit access based on their identity provider group membership.
:category: Redpanda security

GBAC allows you to manage permissions at the group level instead of per user. You can grant permissions to groups in two ways: create xref:ROOT:manage:security/authorization/acl.adoc[ACLs] with `Group:<name>` principals, or assign groups as members of xref:ROOT:manage:security/authorization/rbac.adoc[RBAC] roles. Both approaches can be used independently or together.

For more information, see xref:ROOT:manage:security/authorization/gbac.adoc[].
