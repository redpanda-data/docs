=== rebalancing
:term-name: rebalancing
:hover-text: Process of redistributing partitions and partition leadership for improved performance. 

By default, Redpanda provides _leadership balancing_ and _partition rebalancing_ when brokers are added or decommissioned. 

- Leadership balancing changes where data is read from and written to first, but it does not involve any data transfer. 
- Partition balancing does move partition replicas to alleviate disk pressure and to honor the configured replication factor across nodes and the additional redundancy across failure domains (such as racks). 

With an Enterprise license, you can additionally enable Continuous Data Balancing to continuously monitor broker and rack availability and disk usage.
