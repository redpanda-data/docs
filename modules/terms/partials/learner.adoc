:hover-text: A broker that is a follower in a Raft group but is not part of quorum.
:category: Redpanda core

In a Raft group, a broker can be in learner status. Learners are followers that cannot vote and so do not count towards quorum (the majority). They cannot be elected to leader nor can they trigger leader elections. Brokers can be promoted or demoted between learner and voter. New Raft group members start as learners.
