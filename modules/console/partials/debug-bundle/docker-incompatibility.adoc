If you are running Redpanda in Docker Desktop versions 4.34 and later, generating a debug bundle using Redpanda Console causes Redpanda brokers to crash due to compatibility issues. However, using the xref:reference:rpk/rpk-debug/rpk-debug-bundle.adoc[`rpk debug bundle`] CLI command to generate debug bundles still works as expected.

To use this feature in Redpanda Console, consider an earlier Docker Desktop version or deploy Redpanda on another platform.

This feature is disabled when Redpanda is in xref:reference:properties/broker-properties.adoc#developer_mode[developer mode].
