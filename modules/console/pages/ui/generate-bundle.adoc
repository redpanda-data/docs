When your cluster is unhealthy, Redpanda Console displays debugging data on the *Overview* page. If you are logged in as an admin user, you also get a link to generate a debug bundle.

== Prerequisites

- Redpanda Console must be xref:console:config/connect-to-redpanda.adoc[connected to a Redpanda cluster] and xref:console:config/connect-to-redpanda.adoc#admin[configured to connect to the Redpanda Admin API].

== Generate a debug bundle

You can generate a debug bundle for all brokers in the cluster and download it onto your local computer for inspection.

NOTE: Only one debug bundle can exist at a time. If you generate a new debug bundle, any existing bundle from a previous run will be automatically deleted.

. Click *Debug bundle* next to the spanner icon.
. Click *Generate default*.
. Wait until the process is complete.
. Click *debug-bundle.zip* to download the bundle on your local computer.
. Unzip the file to inspect the contents.

For guidance on reading the debug bundle, see xref:troubleshoot:debug-bundle/inspect.adoc[].

== Delete a debug bundle

To manually delete a debug bundle:

. Click *Debug bundle* next to the spanner icon.
. Click the trash icon next to *debug-bundle.zip* to delete the bundle.
