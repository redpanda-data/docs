:description: Learn how to filter Kafka records using custom JavaScript code within {ui}.

You can use push-down filters in {ui} to search through large Kafka topics that may contain millions of records. Filters are JavaScript functions executed on the backend, evaluating each record individually. Your function must return a boolean:

* `true`: record is included in the frontend results.
* `false`: record is skipped.

Multiple filters combine logically with `AND` conditions.

== Add a JavaScript filter

To add a JavaScript filter:

. Navigate to the topic's *Messages* page.
. Click *Add filter > JavaScript Filter*.
. Define your JavaScript filtering logic in the provided input area.

== Resource usage and performance
JavaScript filters are executed on the backend, consuming CPU and network resources. The performance of your filter depends on the complexity of your JavaScript code and the volume of data being processed.
Typical performance is *15,000-20,000 filtered records/second per CPU core*.
Complex JavaScript logic or large data volumes may increase CPU load and network usage.

== Available JavaScript properties

{ui} injects these properties into your JavaScript context:

[cols="1a,2a,1a"]
|===
| Property         | Description                                      | Type

| `headers`        | Record headers as key-value pairs (ArrayBuffers) | Object
| `key`            | Decoded record key                               | String
| `keySchemaID`    | Schema Registry ID for key (if present)          | Number
| `partitionId`    | Partition ID of the record                       | Number
| `offset`         | Record offset within partition                   | Number
| `timestamp`      | Timestamp as JavaScript Date object              | Date
| `value`          | Decoded record value                             | Object/String
| `valueSchemaID`  | Schema Registry ID for value (if present)        | Number
|===

NOTE: Values, keys, and headers are deserialized before being injected into your script.

== JavaScript filter examples

=== Filter by header value

*Scenario:* Records tagged with headers specifying customer plan type.

.Sample header data
[source,json]
----
headers: {
  "plan_type": "premium"
}
----

.JavaScript filter
[source,javascript]
----
let headerValue = headers["plan_type"];
if (headerValue) {
  let stringValue = String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array(headerValue));
  return stringValue === "premium";
}
return false;
----

=== Filter by timestamp

*Scenario:* Retrieve records from a promotional event (e.g., Black Friday on November 24).

.JavaScript filter
[source,javascript]
----
return timestamp.getMonth() === 10 && timestamp.getDate() === 24;
----

=== Filter by schema ID

*Scenario:* Filter customer activity records based on Avro schema version.

.JavaScript filter
[source,javascript]
----
return valueSchemaID === 204;
----

=== Filter JSON record values

*Scenario:* Filter transactions by customer ID.

.Sample JSON record
[source,json]
----
{
  "transaction_id": "abc123",
  "customer_id": "cust789",
  "amount": 59.99
}
----

.JavaScript filter (top-level property)
[source,javascript]
----
return value.customer_id === "cust789";
----

*Scenario:* Filter orders by item availability.

.Sample JSON record
[source,json]
----
{
  "order_id": "ord456",
  "inventory": {
    "item_id": "itm001",
    "status": "in_stock"
  }
}
----

.JavaScript filter (nested property)
[source,javascript]
----
return value.inventory.status === "in_stock";
----

*Scenario:* Filter products missing price information.

.JavaScript filter (property absence)
[source,javascript]
----
return !value.hasOwnProperty("price");
----

=== Filter string keys

*Scenario:* Filter sensor data records by IoT device ID.

.JavaScript filter
[source,javascript]
----
return key === "sensor-device-1234";
----
