:description: You can use Redpanda Console to monitor the status and performance metrics of your transform functions. You can also view detailed logs and delete transform functions when they are no longer needed.

== Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- Redpanda Console must be xref:console:config/connect-to-redpanda.adoc[connected to a Redpanda cluster].
- Redpanda Console must be xref:console:config/connect-to-redpanda.adoc#admin[configured to connect to the Redpanda Admin API].
- xref:develop:data-transforms/configure.adoc#enable-transforms[Data transforms enabled] in your Redpanda cluster.
- At least one transform function deployed to your Redpanda cluster.

[[monitor]]
== Monitor transform functions

To monitor transform functions in Redpanda Console:

. Navigate to the *Transforms* menu.
. Click on the name of a transform function to view detailed information:
  - The partitions that the function is running on
  - The broker (node) ID
  - Any lag (the amount of pending records on the input topic that have yet to be processed by the transform)

. Navigate to the *Transforms* menu.
. Click on the name of a transform function.
