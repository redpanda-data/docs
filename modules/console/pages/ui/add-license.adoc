You can add or update an xref:get-started:licensing/overview.adoc#console[Enterprise Edition license] for both Redpanda and Redpanda Console directly through the Redpanda Console UI.

== Prerequisites

- You must have an Enterprise Edition license. https://www.redpanda.com/contact[Request a license^] if you don't have one already.

TIP: You can also xref:console:config/enterprise-license.adoc[configure Redpanda Console to load the license key from its local configuration].

== Upload a license

When a license is uploaded through Redpanda Console, it is replicated across the connected Redpanda cluster and stored persistently in Redpanda's internal metadata, ensuring it is retained across restarts.

When a new license is uploaded, enterprise features in Redpanda Self-Managed are unlocked immediately without requiring a cluster restart. However, to unlock enterprise features in Redpanda Console, you must restart the Redpanda Console instance.

After restarting Redpanda Console, enterprise features such as RBAC are unlocked. However, to enable and use these features, you must configure them. See xref:console:config/index.adoc[].
