= Manage Enterprise Edition Licenses through Redpanda Console
:description: Learn how to manage Enterprise Edition licenses in Redpanda Console.

You add, update and check your xref:get-started:licensing/overview.adoc#console[Enterprise Edition license] for both Redpanda and Redpanda Console directly through the Redpanda Console UI.

== Prerequisites

- You must have an Enterprise Edition license. If you don't have a license yet, https://www.redpanda.com/contact[request one^].
+
If Redpanda Console has enterprise features enabled and it cannot find a valid license either locally or in the connected Redpanda cluster, it shuts down.
- Redpanda Console must be xref:console:config/connect-to-redpanda.adoc[connected to a Redpanda cluster].
- Redpanda Console must be xref:console:config/connect-to-redpanda.adoc#admin[configured to connect to the Redpanda Admin API].

TIP: If you don't have Redpanda Console connected to a Redpanda cluster, you can xref:console:config/enterprise-license.adoc[configure Redpanda Console to load the license key from its local configuration].

== Check the license status in Redpanda Console

You can check the expiration date of a license on the Cluster Overview page in Redpanda Console, under the Licensing section.

If the license is due to expire within 30 days, a warning banner is displayed on all pages of Redpanda Console.

See also: xref:get-started:licensing/monitor-license-status.adoc[].

== Upload a new license

When a new license is uploaded through Redpanda Console, it is replicated across the cluster and stored persistently in Redpanda's internal metadata, ensuring it is retained across restarts.

NOTE: Do not use Redpanda Console to upload a new license in Kubernetes. Uploading the license through Redpanda Console does not persist the license in Kubernetes resources such as Secrets or manifests. As a result, the license is lost during Pod restarts, scaling, or redeployments. Instead, use Kubernetes secrets, Helm values, or manifest files to ensure automatic and persistent license management. See xref:get-started:licensing/add-license-redpanda/kubernetes.adoc[].

To upload a new license directly through the Console UI:

. Open the Upload License page. The Upload License page is available at the `admin/upload-license` path or using one of the following methods:
+
- Cluster Overview page:
+
Navigate to the Cluster Overview page in Redpanda Console.
Under the Licensing section, click on the *Upload new license* link to upload a new license key.

- Expiration warning banner:
+
If the existing license expires soon, you can click the *Upload license* button in the expiration warning banner.

. Upload your license.

. Restart the Redpanda Console instance.

When a new license is uploaded, enterprise features in Redpanda Self-Managed are available immediately. However, to enable enterprise features in Redpanda Console, you must restart the Redpanda Console instance.
