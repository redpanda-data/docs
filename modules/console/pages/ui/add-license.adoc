= Manage Enterprise Edition Licenses through Redpanda Console
:description: Learn how to manage Enterprise Edition licenses in Redpanda Console.

You can add, update and check your xref:get-started:licensing/overview.adoc#console[Enterprise Edition license] for both Redpanda and Redpanda Console directly through the Redpanda Console UI.

== Prerequisites

- You must have an Enterprise Edition license. https://www.redpanda.com/contact[Request a license^] if you don't have one already.
- Redpanda Console must be xref:console:config/connect-to-redpanda.adoc[connected to a Redpanda cluster].
- Redpanda Console must be xref:console:config/connect-to-redpanda.adoc#admin[configured to connect to the Redpanda Admin API].

TIP: You can also xref:console:config/enterprise-license.adoc[configure Redpanda Console to load the license key from its local configuration].

== Upload a license

When a license is uploaded through Redpanda Console, it is replicated across the cluster and stored persistently in Redpanda's internal metadata, ensuring it is retained across restarts.

When a new license is uploaded, enterprise features in Redpanda Self-Managed are unlocked immediately without requiring a cluster restart. However, to unlock enterprise features in Redpanda Console, you must restart the Redpanda Console instance.

After restarting Redpanda Console, enterprise features such as RBAC are unlocked. However, to enable and use these features, you must configure them. See xref:console:config/index.adoc[].

== Check the license status in Redpanda Console

You can check the expiration date of a license on the **Cluster Overview** page in Redpanda Console, under the **Licensing** section.

If the license is due to expire within 30 days, a warning banner is displayed on all pages of Redpanda Console.
