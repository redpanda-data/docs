= Manage Enterprise Edition Licenses through Redpanda Console
:description: Learn how to manage Enterprise Edition licenses in Redpanda Console.

You add, update and check your xref:get-started:licensing/overview.adoc#console[Enterprise Edition license] for both Redpanda and Redpanda Console directly through the Redpanda Console UI.

== Prerequisites

- You must have an Enterprise Edition license. If you don't have a license yet, https://www.redpanda.com/contact[request one^].
+
If Redpanda Console has enterprise features enabled and it cannot find a valid license either locally or in the connected Redpanda cluster, it shuts down.
- Redpanda Console must be xref:console:config/connect-to-redpanda.adoc[connected to a Redpanda cluster].
- Redpanda Console must be xref:console:config/connect-to-redpanda.adoc#admin[configured to connect to the Redpanda Admin API].

TIP: You can also xref:console:config/enterprise-license.adoc[configure Redpanda Console to load the license key from its local configuration].

== Check the license status in Redpanda Console

You can check the expiration date of a license on the Cluster Overview page in Redpanda Console, under the Licensing section.

If the license is due to expire within 30 days, a warning banner is displayed on all pages of Redpanda Console.

See also: xref:get-started:licensing/monitor-license-status.adoc[].

== Upload a new license

When a new license is uploaded through Redpanda Console, it is replicated across the cluster and stored persistently in Redpanda's internal metadata, ensuring it is retained across restarts.

NOTE: If you use Kubernetes to deploy Redpanda, do not use Redpanda Console to update the license if it's already set in your Kubernetes resources. During upgrades or redeployments, license values in your Kubernetes resources will override the license set using Redpanda Console. For consistent license management, set the license using either Redpanda Console or Kubernetes resources, but not both.


To upload a new license directly through the Console UI:

. Open the Upload License page, using one of the following methods:
+
- Cluster Overview page:
+
Navigate to the Cluster Overview page in Redpanda Console.
Under the Licensing section, click on the *Upload new license* link to upload a new license key.

- Expiration warning banner:
+
If the existing license expires soon, you can click the *Upload license* button in the expiration warning banner.

. Upload your license.

When a new license is uploaded, enterprise features in Redpanda Self-Managed are unlocked immediately without requiring a cluster restart. However, to unlock enterprise features in Redpanda Console, you must restart the Redpanda Console instance.

After restarting Redpanda Console, enterprise features such as RBAC are unlocked. However, to enable and use these features, you must configure them. See xref:console:config/index.adoc[].
