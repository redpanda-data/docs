= Check License Status in Redpanda Console
:description: Learn how to check the status of your Redpanda Enterprise Edition license using the Redpanda Console. This topic includes steps to check license details and understand license warnings.

You can check the expiration date of a license on the **Cluster Overview** page in Redpanda Console, under the **Licensing** section.

Redpanda Console tries to load a valid license at startup in the following order:

. From the local configuration file or environment variables.
. From the connected Redpanda cluster (if available).

== Prerequisites

- Redpanda Console must have an Enterprise Edition license. https://www.redpanda.com/try-enterprise[Request a license^] if you don't have one already.

== Check the expiration date of a license

. Go to the *Cluster Overview* page.
. Locate the *Licensing* section.
. Review the license details.
