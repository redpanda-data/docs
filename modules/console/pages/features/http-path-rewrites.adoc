= HTTP Path Rewrites
:description: If you want to host Redpanda Console under a sub-path rather than the root path, you need to configure this. This page explains how you can configure Console to comply with your URL rewrites.

To host Redpanda Console under an HTTP path different from the root path (for example `\https://my-company.com/redpanda/console`),
then you need to configure this in Redpanda Console. If you host Redpanda Console at a root path (for example under a sub-domain, such as `\https://console.redpanda.my-company.com`),
you don't need to configure HTTP path rewrites.

== Configuration

To configure HTTP path rewrites, you must edit the following properties in the console.yaml file:

* `basePath`
* `setBasePathFromXForwardedPrefix`
* `stripPrefix`

As shown in the following code snippet, properties are defined in the server block.

[,yaml]
----
server:
  # basePath is the sub-path under which Console will be hosted.
  # If you have a reverse proxy in front of Console, that sets
  # the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header and the configuration property
  # setBasePathFromXForwardedPrefix is true, you don't need to set
  # this.
  basePath: ""

  # If true, Console will check the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header
  # on all incoming requests. If the header is present, its value
  # will be used as path prefix.
  setBasePathFromXForwardedPrefix: true

  # Some reverse proxies (like Traefik with its StripPrefix middleware)
  # can remove a prefix from the URL path before forwarding it to
  # downstream services like Console. If a prefix is set, it must be
  # removed at some point before reaching Console's internal routing.
  # We recommend that only one part of the stack removes the
  # prefix. If you are using a reverse proxy that modifies the
  # request path, you should either disable stripPrefix or
  # configure the proxy so it doesn't modify the path of a request.
  stripPrefix: true
