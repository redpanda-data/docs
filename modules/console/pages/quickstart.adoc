This command deploys Redpanda and Redpanda Console, which is exposed on port 8080 and connected to your Redpanda cluster at localhost:9092.

== Access Redpanda Console

When Redpanda Console is running, open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8080 to see an overview of your cluster's status, health, and broker details.

// (step {"action":"checkLink", "url": "http://localhost:8080"})
// (step {"action":"goTo", "url": "http://localhost:8080/overview"})
// (step {"action":"wait"})
// (step {"action":"saveScreenshot", "path": "overview.png", "directory": "../images", "overwrite": "byVariation"})

image::overview.png[]

To view details about a specific broker, click *View* at the end of the row in the *Broker Details* table.

// (step {"action":"find", "selector": ".chakra-table tbody tr:last-child td:last-child button", "matchText": "View", "click": true})
// (step {"action":"wait"})
// (step {"action":"saveScreenshot", "path": "broker-overview.png", "directory": "../images", "overwrite": "byVariation"})

== View topics and filter messages

If you're working with a particular topic, you can view its configuration, inspect its messages, and see which consumers are connected.

You can filter messages using several methods:

- Text search: Search for specific text within the message.
- Partition offset filters: Set the start and end offsets to narrow down the message range.
- JavaScript filters: Use JavaScript function bodies to create complex filters that run server-side.

Suppose you're asked to find all transactions related to the `.edu` domain. You can use a JavaScript filter to display only messages that include email address in that domain.

. In the left menu, click *Topics*.
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "span[data-testid='nav-link-Topics']", "matchText": "Topics", "click": true})
. Click on the *transactions* topic. When the topic's page opens, the messages tab is selected by default.
// (step {"action":"goTo", "url": "http://localhost:8080/topics/transactions"})
// (step {"action":"wait"})
. Click *Add filter* > *JavaScript Filter*.
// (step {"action":"saveScreenshot", "path": "topic.png", "directory": "../images", "overwrite": "byVariation"})
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='add-topic-filter']", "matchText": "Add filter", "click": true, "timeout": 10000})
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='add-topic-filter-javascript']", "matchText": "JavaScript Filter", "click": true, "timeout": 10000})
. Give your filter a name such as 'Find .edu domains'.
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='add-javascript-filter-name']", "typeKeys": "Find .edu domains", "click": true, "timeout": 10000})
// (step {"action":"saveScreenshot", "path": "js-filter.png", "directory": "../images", "overwrite": "byVariation"})
+
image::js-filter.png[]
. Replace the default JavaScript code with the following:
+
[,js]
----
return value.email.includes(".edu");
----
. Click *Save* to apply the filter.
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='add-javascript-filter-save']", "matchText": "Save", "click": true})
+
You should see only messages that include the specific domain.

By default, the filter runs on the newest 50 messages. You can run the filter on older messages by changing the start offset. For example, to start from the oldest messages, select *Oldest*.
// (step {"action":"goTo", "url": "http://localhost:8080/topics/transactions"})
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": ".chakra-tabs__tablist button[data-index='5']", "matchText": "Documentation", "click": true})
// (step {"action":"saveScreenshot", "path": "topic-documentation.png", "directory": "../images", "overwrite": "byVariation"})

== Schema Registry

In the *Schema Registry* menu, you can see an overview of your schemas as well as create, manage, and inspect your schemas without leaving Redpanda Console.

// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "span[data-testid='nav-link-Schema Registry']", "matchText": "Schema Registry", "click": true})
// (step {"action":"goTo", "url": "http://localhost:8080/schema-registry/subjects/transactions?version=latest"})
// (step {"action":"wait"})
// (step {"action":"saveScreenshot", "path": "schema-reg.png", "directory": "../images", "overwrite": "byVariation"})

image::schema-reg.png[]

For more details, see xref:console:ui/schema-reg.adoc[].

== Manage consumer groups

In the *Consumer Groups* menu, you can see detailed insights into consumer groups, including their configuration and status. You can:

- See which members are assigned to partitions.
- Monitor consumer lag to ensure your consumers are keeping up with the data stream.

If a consumer group falls behind, you can check the lag directly in Redpanda Console and, if necessary, reset the offsets to reprocess messages from a specific point.

== Configure access control for Redpanda

Managing access control lists (ACLs) in Redpanda can be complex, but Redpanda Console simplifies this with an intuitive interface.

In the *Security* menu, you can:

- Create, view, and edit ACLs for topics, consumer groups, transactions and the entire cluster.
- Quickly understand what each principal (user) is authorized to do.

Suppose you're onboarding a new team member who needs access to specific topics and consumer groups. You can use Redpanda Console to ensure users have the right permissions to perform their tasks.

. In the left menu, click *Security*.
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "span[data-testid='nav-link-Security']", "matchText": "Security", "click": true})
. In the *Users* tab, click *Create user*.
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='create-user-button']", "matchText": "Create user", "click": true})
. Enter "Sasha" in the username field.
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='create-user-name']", "typeKeys": "Sasha", "click": true})
. Enter "secretpassword" in the password field.
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='password-input-toggle']", "click": true})
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='test_field']", "setVariables": [{"name": "password","regex": ".*"}], "click": true})
// (step {"action":"find", "selector": "[data-testid='password-input-toggle']", "click": true})
// (step {"action":"saveScreenshot", "path": "user.png", "directory": "../images", "overwrite": "byVariation"})
. Click *Create*.

image::user.png[]

You now have a new user called Sasha. But this user has no permissions yet.

. In the *ACLs* tab, click *Create ACL*.
. Enter "Sasha" in the user/principal field.
. In the topic selector dropdown, select *Literal* and enter "transactions" in the input field.
. Under *Operations*, click the *All* dropdown and select *Allow*.
. Scroll down and click *OK*.

Now Sasha has full access only to the topic called transactions.

To test these permissions, you can use a Kafka client library or the [Redpanda CLI (`rpk`)] to connect to Redpanda as the user Sasha.

. xref:get-started:rpk-install.adoc[Install `rpk`] on your local machine.
. Try to access the `logins` topic as Sasha:
+
[,bash]
----
rpk topic describe logins \
  -X user=Sasha \
  -X pass=secretpassword \
  -X sasl.mechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256 \
  -X brokers=localhost:19092
----
+
You are not authorized to view the topic.
+
[.no-copy]
----
SUMMARY
=======
NAME        logins
PARTITIONS  0
ERROR       TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED: Not authorized to access topics: [Topic authorization failed.]

CONFIGS
=======
config response contained error: TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED: Not authorized to access topics: [Topic authorization failed.]
----

. Access the `transactions` topic.
+
[,bash]
----
rpk topic describe transactions \
  -X user=Sasha \
  -X pass=secretpassword \
  -X sasl.mechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256 \
  -X brokers=localhost:19092
----
+
You have access to this topic.

== Monitor client quotas

Redpanda provides configurable throughput quotas that apply to an individual client or a group of clients. You can view quotas for an individual client based on an exact match with its `client_id`, or a group of clients based on IDs that start with a given prefix.

See also: xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/manage-throughput.adoc[]

== Connectors

In the *Connectors* menu, you can manage your Kafka Connect clusters or view instructions for deploying Redpanda Connect.

See also:

- xref:console:config/kafka-connect.adoc[Manage Kafka Connect in Redpanda Console]
- xref:redpanda-connect:ROOT:about.adoc[About Redpanda Connect]

== Data transforms

Data transforms let you run common data streaming tasks, like filtering, scrubbing, and transcoding, on the Redpanda broker. For example, you may have consumers that require you to redact credit card numbers or convert JSON to Avro. Data transforms can also interact with the Redpanda Schema Registry to work with encoded data types.

You can use Redpanda Console to manage and monitor your transform functions.
