= Configure Redpanda Console
:description: Redpanda Console configuration file with property descriptions.
:page-aliases: console:reference/config.adoc, reference:console/config.adoc

Redpanda Console loads configuration properties from three sources, in the following order of precedence:

* Environment variables
* YAML file configuration (recommended)
* Command-line arguments

Environment variables and YAML configurations can overwrite input that is set on the command line.

== YAML file configuration

The recommended configuration source is a YAML file. You can specify the path to the configuration file by setting either
the `-config.filepath` flag or the `CONFIG_FILEPATH` environment variable.
A reference configuration file is provided under <<Example Redpanda Console configuration file>>.

In Linux package installations, this file is located in `/etc/redpanda/redpanda-console-config.yaml` by default and Redpanda Console is configured to read from this file path.

In containerized environments, you must ensure that the configuration file is mounted to a directory accessible by the Redpanda Console container. When the file is mounted, you can specify its file path using the `-config.filepath` flag or the `CONFIG_FILEPATH` environment variable.

== Environment variables

Configuration options can be configured using environment variables. The key for the environment
variable is auto-generated by converting the YAML equivalent to uppercase and adding an underscore for each indentation level. For example:

[cols="1m,1m"]
|===
|YAML|Environment Variable

|kafka.rackId
|KAFKA_RACKID

|kafka.tls.caFilepath
|KAFKA_TLS_CAFILEPATH
|===

For configuration properties that expect a list of values, use commas between each value. For example:

[,bash]
----
KAFKA_BROKERS=redpanda-0:9092,redpanda-1:9092,redpanda-2:9092
----

NOTE: You cannot use environment variables to configure object arrays, such as the configuration
for Kafka Connect clusters. In this case, use a YAML file, and provide secrets using environment variables or command line arguments.

== Example Redpanda Console configuration file

The following YAML file contains a complete list of all Redpanda Console configuration properties and their descriptions. All values are default values.

[CAUTION]
====
* Where necessary, ensure that values are enclosed in quotes and escaped. For example, put passwords with special characters in single quotes.
* This configuration file contains both Redpanda Enterprise and Redpanda Community Edition configurations. If you don't provide an Enterprise license, Redpanda Console ignores configurations for enterprise features.
