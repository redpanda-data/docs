= Configure Message Deserialization in Redpanda Console
:description: Configure Redpanda Console to use Schema Registry, Protobuf files, and other deserialization methods to ensure your data is correctly interpreted and displayed.

Redpanda Console provides tools for deserializing and inspecting messages in Kafka topics. This topic explains how to configure Redpanda Console to use Schema Registry, Protobuf files, and other deserialization methods to ensure your data is correctly interpreted and displayed.

== Use Schema Registry

The Schema Registry allows Redpanda Console to dynamically retrieve schemas for deserializing Avro, Protobuf, and JSON messages. This setup is important to ensure that messages are correctly interpreted based on your schema definitions.

To configure Redpanda Console to use the Schema Registry, include the following configuration in your configuration file:

[source,yaml]
----
schemaRegistry:
  enabled: true
  urls:
    - "broker1.example.com:8081"
    - "broker2.example.com:8081"

  # Optional authentication settings:
  # authentication:
    # impersonateUser: true # Use the logged-in user's credentials for authentication.
    # basic:
      # username: "example-user"
      # password: "example-password"
    # bearerToken: "example-bearer-token"
----

[cols="1a,4a"]
|===
| Option | Description

| `urls`
| A list of Schema Registry endpoints in the format `<hostname>:<port>`. Include all endpoints for redundancy.

| `authentication` (optional)
| Configure authentication for the Schema Registry. Options include basic authentication or bearer tokens. For more detailed instructions on configuring authentication, see xref:console:config/security/authentication.adoc[].

== Protobuf configuration

Redpanda Console supports several methods for providing Protobuf schemas, including the Schema Registry, local file system, and GitHub repositories.

NOTE: You don't need to provide standard types, such as Google's timestamp, in your schemas. These standard types are included by default.

Most Kafka clients that serialize Protobuf messages put the serialized byte array into a binary wrapper that contains meta information, like the schema ID or the used prototypes, so the application that deserializes the Kafka records must recognize the format. The deserialization process requires {ui} to be aware of the used Protobuf files as well as a mapping of what prototype should be used for each topic. This information can either be sourced from the Schema Registry or it can be provided with additional configuration so the files can be pulled from the local file system or a GitHub repository.

=== Use Schema Registry for Protobuf

If you use a Schema Registry for Protobuf deserialization, Redpanda Console can automatically fetch and use the required schemas without the need for <<topic-mapping, manual topic mappings>>. Because the schema information (including which Protobuf message type to use) is embedded in the messages, you do not need to manually configure mappings for each topic. The Schema Registry provides the necessary schema information to deserialize the messages.

To configure Protobuf deserialization using Schema Registry, add the following to your configuration file in addition to the <<sr, `schemaRegistry` configuration>>:

[,yaml]
----
serde:
  protobuf:
    enabled: true
----

- `serde.protobuf.enabled`: Set to `true` to enable Protobuf deserialization.

When using Schema Registry for Protobuf, you do not need to provide specific topic mappings, as the schemas will be fetched dynamically.

=== Topic mapping

If you're not <<sr-protobuf, using a Schema Registry for Protobuf deserialization>>, you must manually provide mappings between Kafka topics and their corresponding Protobuf types. This is necessary to inform Redpanda Console of the correct types to use for deserialization.

Consider a Kafka topic called `address-v1` and a corresponding `address.proto` file with the following structure:

.`address.proto`
[,proto]
----
syntax = "proto3";
package fake_models;

option go_package = "pkg/protobuf";

message Address {
  int32 version = 1;
  string id = 2;
  message Customer {
    string customer_id = 1;
    string customer_type = 2;
  }
}
----

To map this topic to the Protobuf schema, use the following configuration:

[,yaml]
----
serde:
  protobuf:
    enabled: true
    mappings:
    - topicName: address-v1
      valueProtoType: fake_models.Address # The full Protobuf type name
      # keyProtoType: Not specified because the key is a plain string
----

* `serde.protobuf.mappings.topicName`: The name of the Kafka topic.
* `serde.protobuf.mappings.valueProtoType`: The fully-qualified Protobuf type for the message value.
* `serde.protobuf.mappings.keyProtoType`: Specify the key Protobuf type if the key is not a plain string.

=== Local file system

You can mount Protobuf files directly from your local file system. Redpanda Console will search the specified paths for Protobuf files and build a registry with all the available types.

Configuration example:

[,yaml]
----
serde:
  protobuf:
    enabled: true
    mappings:
      - topicName: orders
        valueProtoType: fake_models.Order
        keyProtoType: fake_models.OrderKey
    fileSystem:
      enabled: true
      # How often to refresh the Protobuf files from the filesystem
      refreshInterval: 5m
      # Directories containing the Protobuf files
      paths:
        - /etc/protos
----

* `serde.protobuf.fileSystem.paths`: Paths to directories where Protobuf files are stored.
* `serde.protobuf.fileSystem.refreshInterval`: The frequency at which Redpanda Console checks for updates to these files.

=== GitHub repository

If your Protobuf files are stored in a GitHub repository, Redpanda Console can fetch and use them directly. This is particularly useful if your organization maintains Protobuf definitions in version control.

Configuration example:

[,yaml]
----
serde:
  protobuf:
    enabled: true
    mappings:
      - topicName: orders
        valueProtoType: fake_models.Order
        keyProtoType: fake_models.OrderKey
    importPaths: []
    git:
      enabled: true
      refreshInterval: 5m
      repository:
        url: https://github.com/your-org/protos.git
      basicAuth:
        enabled: true
        username: token
        password: redacted
----

* `serde.protobuf.git.repository.url`: The URL of the GitHub repository containing your Protobuf files.
* `serde.protobuf.git.basicAuth`: Basic authentication credentials, often an API token for private repositories.
* `serde.protobuf.git.refreshInterval`: Frequency at which the repository is polled for updates.

== MessagePack deserialization

If your data is serialized using MessagePack, Redpanda Console can be configured to deserialize it.

[,yaml]
----
serde:
  messagePack:
    enabled: true
    # Define which topics use MessagePack serialization
    # Regex to match all topics by default
    topicNames: ["/.*/"]
----

* `serde.messagePack.enabled`: Enables MessagePack deserialization.
* `serde.messagePack.topicNames`: A list of topic name regex patterns that specify which topics use MessagePack serialization. The default pattern (`/.*/`) matches all topics.

== Best practices

- Use Schema Registry when possible.
+
Schema Registry simplifies schema management and ensures that all messages are serialized and deserialized consistently across your Kafka ecosystem.
- Organize Protobuf files.
+
Whether using a local file system or a GitHub repository, keep your Protobuf files organized and use consistent naming conventions to avoid confusion.
- Monitor deserialization performance.
+
Regularly check the performance impact of deserialization, especially when using complex Protobuf schemas or large numbers of messages. Adjust refresh intervals and schema caching as needed.
- Secure access.
+
Ensure that credentials for accessing the Schema Registry or GitHub repositories are securely managed and rotated regularly.

== Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with deserialization:

- Ensure that the Schema Registry URL and credentials are correctly configured and accessible.
- Check your topic mappings and Protobuf type names for accuracy.
- Review the Redpanda Console for insights into any errors occurring during deserialization.
