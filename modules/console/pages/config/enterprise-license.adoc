To enable xref:get-started:licensing/overview.adoc#console[enterprise features for Redpanda Console], you must have an Enterprise Edition license to load at startup. This guide explains how to configure Redpanda Console to load the license key from its local configuration.

TIP: This option is best for deployments that are not connected to a Redpanda cluster. If you plan to connect Redpanda Console to a Redpanda cluster, consider uploading the license to the Redpanda cluster. See xref:get-started:licensing/add-license-console.adoc[].

== Prerequisites

You must have an Enterprise Edition license. To get a trial license key or extend your trial period, https://redpanda.com/try-enterprise[generate a new trial license key^]. To purchase a license, contact https://redpanda.com/upgrade[Redpanda Sales^].

If Redpanda Console has enterprise features enabled and cannot find a valid license locally or in the connected Redpanda cluster, it shuts down. See xref:get-started:licensing/overview.adoc[].

== Add a new license to Redpanda Console

To add a new license to Redpanda Console, you have two options:

- <<file, Provide the path to the license file>>.
- <<inline, Provide the license key contents directly>>.

[[file]]
=== Use a license file

Specify the path to the license file in one of the following ways:

- Set the `licenseFilepath` property in the `/etc/redpanda/redpanda-console-config.yaml` configuration file:
+
```yaml
licenseFilepath: <path-to-license-file>
```
- Set the `REDPANDA_LICENSE_FILEPATH` environment variable:
+
```bash
export REDPANDA_LICENSE_FILEPATH=<path-to-license-file>
```

[[inline]]
=== Use the license key contents directly

If you don't want to provide a path to the license file, you can use the contents of the license key directly in one of the following ways:

- Set the `license` property in the `/etc/redpanda/redpanda-console-config.yaml` configuration file:
+
```yaml
license: <license-key-contents>
```

- Set the `REDPANDA_LICENSE` environment variable:
+
```yaml
export REDPANDA_LICENSE=<license-key-contents>
```

== Update an existing license

To update an existing license:

. Update your configuration file or environment variables with one of the following:

- <<file, The path to your new license file>>
- <<inline, The contents of your new license key>>

. Restart Redpanda Console to make the changes take effect.
