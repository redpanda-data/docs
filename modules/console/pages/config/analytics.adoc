= Redpanda Console Telemetry
:description: Learn what telemetry Redpanda Console collects by default, how it is handled, and how to disable it.

Redpanda Console collects telemetry (analytics) data for purposes including product improvements and user experience optimization. This document explains what data is collected, how it is processed, and how you can disable telemetry if desired.

== What is tracked by default

When telemetry is enabled, which is the default behavior, Redpanda Console collects metadata and sends it securely to Redpanda.

=== Redpanda Console metadata

The following information is collected from the running instance of Redpanda Console:

- Startup timestamp (when the Redpanda Console process starts)
- Runtime UUID (a unique ID generated per instance)
- Redpanda Console version and build timestamp
- License hash, license type, and license organization
- Kafka configuration hash (anonymized)
- Whether Kafka is connected as `localhost`
- Behavioral user analytics

=== Cluster metadata

The following information is collected from the connected Kafka cluster:

- Cluster configuration details (excluding sensitive values)
- Broker log dir statistics such as the size
- Topic configurations (settings only, no message contents)
- Consumer group metadata (total count, and counts by protocol and state)
- General cluster metadata:
** Number of brokers
** Number of topics
** Number of partitions
** Number of racks
** Cluster ID

== How telemetry data is handled

Telemetry data is processed with the following features:

- All telemetry payloads are signed and encoded as JWTs
- Data is sent using HTTPS POST requests to Redpanda's telemetry endpoint
- Configuration data is anonymized using secure hashes
- No message contents or credentials are collected or transmitted

== Disable telemetry

To turn off telemetry and user tracking, set the following in your Redpanda Console configuration:

[tabs]
======
Standalone::
+
--

[source,yaml]
----
analytics:
  enabled: false
----

--

Kubernetes embedded::
+
--

When Redpanda Console is part of the Redpanda Helm chart or Operator:

[tabs]
====
Operator::
+
[,yaml]
.`redpanda-console`.yaml
----
apiVersion: cluster.redpanda.com/v1alpha2
kind: Console
metadata:
  name: redpanda-console
spec:
  clusterRef:
    name: redpanda
  config:
    analytics:
      enabled: false
----

Helm::
+
[,yaml]
.`redpanda-values.yaml`
----
console:
  enabled: true
  console:
    config:
      analytics:
        enabled: false
----
====
--
Kubernetes standalone::
+
--

When using the standalone Redpanda Console Helm chart:

[,yaml]
.`console-values.yaml`
----
config:
  analytics:
    enabled: false
----

--
======

Restart the Redpanda Console service to apply the change and stop all telemetry and user tracking.
