= Redpanda Console Telemetry
:description: Understand what telemetry Redpanda Console collects by default, how it is handled, and how to disable it.

Redpanda Console collects telemetry (analytics) data to improve the product and user experience. This document explains what data is collected, how it is processed, and how you can disable telemetry if desired.

== What is tracked by default

When telemetry is enabled, which is the default behavior, Redpanda Console collects metadata to help improve product functionality and reliability. This data is sent securely to Redpanda.

=== Redpanda Console metadata

The following information is collected from the running instance of Redpanda Console:

- Startup timestamp (when the Redpanda Console process starts)
- Runtime UUID (a unique ID generated per instance)
- Redpanda Console version and build timestamp
- License hash, license type, and license organization
- Kafka configuration hash (anonymized)
- Whether Kafka is connected as `localhost`

=== Redpanda cluster metadata

The following information is collected from the connected Kafka cluster:

- Cluster configuration details (excluding sensitive values)
- Broker log directories
- Topic configurations (settings only, no message contents)
- Consumer group metadata (names and counts only)
- General cluster metadata:
** Number of brokers
** Number of topics
** Number of partitions

=== User tracking

Redpanda Console also tracks individual users for behavior analytics using the following tools:

- link:https://www.heap.io/[Heap]
- link:https://www.hubspot.com/[Hubspot]

Tracking is enabled per unique Redpanda Console user and is used for improving the product experience. No personally identifiable information (PII) is sent.

== How telemetry data is handled

Telemetry data is processed with the following guarantees:

- All telemetry payloads are signed and encoded as JWTs
- Data is sent using HTTPS POST requests to Redpanda's telemetry endpoint
- Data is sent periodically (default interval: every 24 hours)
- Configuration data is anonymized using secure hashes
- No message contents, credentials, or PII are collected or transmitted

== Disable telemetry

To turn off telemetry and user tracking, set the following in your Console configuration file:

[source,yaml]
----
analytics:
  enabled: false
----

Restart the Redpanda Console service to apply the change and stop all telemetry and user tracking.
