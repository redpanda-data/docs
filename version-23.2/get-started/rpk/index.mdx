- [Intro to rpk](../intro-to-rpk)

    The `rpk` application is a single binary that lets you interact with your Redpanda clusters from the command line. 

- [Broker and Admin API Addresses](../broker-admin)

    For `rpk` to know where to run Kafka-related or admin-related commands, you must provide the broker addresses or admin server addresses for each node of a Redpanda cluster. 

- [Install rpk](../rpk-install.mdx)

    Install `rpk`as a standalone tool for self-hosted, cloud, or Kubernetes deployments.
