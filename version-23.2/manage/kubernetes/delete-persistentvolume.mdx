Deleting a PersistentVolume (PV) can be necessary for a variety of reasons, such as removing a broker and its data from the cluster or performing maintenance or upgrades on the PersistentVolume.

## Prerequisites

- A running Redpanda deployment on a Kubernetes cluster.

- PersistentVolumes for either the Redpanda data directory or the Tiered Storage cache.

## Delete a PersistentVolume

To delete a PersistentVolume, follow these steps to ensure that your data is moved to other brokers in the cluster.

1. Identify the PV that you want to delete:

  ```bash
  kubectl get persistentvolume
  ```

1. Decommission the broker that has a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) bound to the PV. Decommissioning ensures no data loss by gracefully moving the broker's topic partitions and replicas to other brokers in the cluster. See [Decommission Brokers](../decommission-brokers).

1. Delete the PVC that is bound to your PV:

  ```bash
  kubectl delete persistentvolumeclaim <pvc-name> --namespace <namespace>
  ```

1. If the `reclaimPolicy` of your PV is not `Delete`, delete the PV:

  ```bash
  kubectl delete persistentvolume <pv-name>
  ```

1. Delete the Pod whose PVC was bound to the deleted PV:

  The StatefulSet schedules a new Pod on the same worker node and assigns it a unique node ID.

  If you use PVs for the Redpanda data directory, the Pod will have a new PVC bound to a PV that is set in [`storage.persistentVolume.storageClass`](../../../reference/redpanda-helm-spec#storagepersistentvolumestorageclass). See [Use PersistentVolumes](../configure-storage).

  If you use PVs for the Tiered Storage cache, the Pod will have a new PVC bound to a PV that is set in [`storage.tieredStoragePersistentVolume.storageClass`](../../../reference/redpanda-helm-spec#storagetieredstoragepersistentvolumestorageclass). See [Tiered Storage Caching](../tiered-storage#caching).

1. Verify that the new Redpanda broker is running and that it has access to the appropriate PersistentVolume.

    rpk cluster info \
      -X brokers=<broker-url>:<kafka-api-port>
  ```

  </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

  You should see your new broker running with a new node ID.
