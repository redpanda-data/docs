## Configure rack awareness

The instructions in this section are based on a cluster with five brokers and three failure zones. The failure zones, or racks, are identified as A, B, and C, with brokers assigned to them:

<table className={styles.rackAwarenessTable}>
    <tr>
        <td>Broker</td>
        <td>Rack</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>B</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>C</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>C</td>
    </tr>
</table>

To set up rack awareness for this cluster:
1. Open a terminal window and log in to broker 1 on the cluster.
2. Run `rpk cluster config edit`.
3. In the text editor window that opens, set `enable_rack_awareness` to `true`.
4. Save your change and quit the editor.
5. Go to the `/etc/redpanda` directory.
6. Open the `redpanda.yaml` file for editing.
7. In the `redpanda` section, add the `rack` property and set the value to A as shown:
    ```yaml
    rack: "A"
    ```
8. Log in to the remaining brokers and edit their `redpanda.yaml` files. For broker 2, set `rack` to `A`. For broker 3, set `rack` to `B`. For brokers 4 and 5, set `rack` to `C`.
9. Restart each broker in the cluster for the rack assignments to take effect.

:::tip
For high availability, Redpanda recommends adding one or more brokers from each zone to the `seed_servers` configuration.

## Next steps

Use rack awareness with [Continuous Data Balancing](../cluster-maintenance/continuous-data-balancing/) to continually maintain the configured replication level, even after a rack failure. For a given partition, Redpanda tries to move excess replicas from racks that have more than one replica to racks that have no replicas.
