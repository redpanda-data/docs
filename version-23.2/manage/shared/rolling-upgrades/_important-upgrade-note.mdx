- New features are enabled after all brokers (nodes) in the cluster are upgraded. You can stop the upgrade process and roll back to the original version as long as you have not upgraded every broker and restarted the cluster.
- Redpanda supports upgrading only one sequential feature release at a time. For example, you can upgrade from the 22.2 feature release to 22.3. You cannot skip feature releases. 
- Redpanda supports downgrading only between patch releases of the same feature release. For example, you can downgrade from the 22.2.2 patch release to 22.2.1, but you cannot downgrade to 22.1.7.
- Tiered Storage: When upgrading to Redpanda 23.2, uploads to object storage are paused until all brokers in the cluster are upgraded. If the cluster gets stuck while upgrading, roll it back to the original version. In a mixed-version state, the cluster could run out of disk space. If you need to force a mixed-version cluster to upload, move partition leadership to brokers running the original version. 
- Remote Read Replicas: Upgrade the Remote Read Replica cluster before upgrading the origin cluster. The Remote Read Replica cluster must run on the same version of Redpanda as the origin cluster, or just one feature release ahead of the origin cluster. When upgrading to Redpanda 23.2, metadata from object storage is not synchronized until all brokers in the cluster are upgraded. If you need to force a mixed-version cluster to sync read replicas, move partition leadership to brokers running the original version.
- [Controller snapshots](../../../get-started/architecture#controller-partition-and-snapshots) are disabled in upgraded clusters. To enable them, contact [Redpanda Support](https://support.redpanda.com/hc/en-us).
