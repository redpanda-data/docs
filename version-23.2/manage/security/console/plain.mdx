Configuring Redpanda Console with a plain login provider allows your users to authenticate with a predefined
username and password. Plain logins are the easiest way to set up a login-protected deployment of Redpanda Console. However,
plain logins are not secure, and Redpanda recommends them only for development environments or demo purposes.

:::tip
You can test this feature using Docker Compose. See the [Plain login authentication for Redpanda Console](../../../../reference/docker-compose#plain-login-authentication-for-redpanda-console) sample.
:::

To configure a plain login provider, you must:

1. [Configure the plain login provider with user credentials](#configure-the-plain-login-provider-with-user-credentials).
1. [Define role-bindings for the users](#define-role-bindings).

## Configure the plain login provider with user credentials

To configure the users' plain login credentials, add them to the `login.plain.credentials` setting in the [Redpanda Console Configuration](../../../../reference/console/config).

```yaml title="redpanda-console-config.yaml"
login:
  enabled: true

  # jwtSecret is the secret key you must use to sign and encrypt the JSON 
  # web token used to store user sessions. This secret key is 
  # critical for the security of Redpanda Console's authentication and 
  # authorization system. Use a long, complex key with a combination of 
  # numbers, letters, and special characters. While you must use a minimum of 
  # 10 characters, Redpanda recommends using more than 32 
  # characters. For additional security, use a different secret key for 
  # each environment. jwtSecret can be securely generated with the following 
  # command: LC_ALL=C tr -dc '[:alnum:]' < /dev/random | head -c32
  #
  # If you update this secret key, any users who are 
  # already logged into Redpanda Console will be logged out and will have 
  # to log in again.
  jwtSecret: ""

  # useSecureCookies controls the storage of session cookies in Console.
  # Enabling this option ensures that session cookies are stored with the 
  # secure attribute, allowing them to be sent only over HTTPS.
  # If you are not using SSL in your environment, you must 
  # disable this setting.
  useSecureCookies: false

  plain:
    enabled: true
    # Credentials are username and password combinations that you can use to log in.
    # By default, each user has no permissions. You must bind a role to the user.
    credentials:
      - username: "jane"
        password: "some-other-secret-password"
      - username: "john"
        password: "some-secret-password"
```

:::note
Disable the `useSecureCookies` option shown in the code snippet if Console is exposed using HTTP instead of HTTPS.
:::

## Define role-bindings

By default, each user has no permissions. To give users permissions, you must bind a role to them. After you've [configured the plain login provider](#configure-the-plain-login-provider-with-user-credentials), you can bind users to roles in the [Redpanda Console Role-Binding Configuration](../../../../reference/console/role-bindings).

```yaml title="role-bindings.yaml"
roleBindings:
  - metadata:
      name: Platform Ops
    subjects:
      - kind: user
        provider: Plain
        name: jane
    roleName: admin
  - metadata:
      name: Software Engineers
    subjects:
      - kind: user
        provider: Plain
        name: john
    roleName: editor
```

## Next steps
