Redpanda recommends that you always configure encryption, authentication, and authorization for production environments. 

- [Configure Authentication](../security/authentication)
  
  Enable and configure authentication. Different components of Redpanda support different authentication methods.

- [Configure Authorization](../security/authorization)
  
  Configure access-control lists (ACLs) to enable fine-grained access to provisioned users. 

- [Configure Kafka TLS Encryption](../security/encryption)
  
  A security best practice is to enable encryption with TLS or mTLS. 

- [Configure Listeners](../security/listener-configuration)

  Use listeners to advertise the location of the broker, so other brokers in the cluster can be found. 

- [Redpanda Console Security](../security/console)

  See security topics specific to Redpanda Console. 

- [IAM Roles](../security/iam-roles)

  For self-hosted clusters on a public cloud, cloud provider IAM roles provide a safer alternative to static credentials based on access keys.

:::note
All concepts described in this section are compatible with Kafka and its client libraries and CLIs. This section does not cover ways you can protect your Redpanda cluster externally; for example, through network ACLs or private networks.
