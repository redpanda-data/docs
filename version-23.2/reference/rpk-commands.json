        "description": "Manage ACLs and SASL users.\n\nThis command space creates, lists, and deletes ACLs, as well as creates SASL\nusers. The help text below is specific to ACLs. To learn about SASL users,\ncheck the help text under the \"user\" command.\n\nWhen using SASL, ACLs allow or deny you access to certain requests. The\n\"create\", \"delete\", and \"list\" commands help you manage your ACLs.\n\nAn ACL is made up of five components:\n\n  * a principal (the user)\n  * a host the principal is allowed or denied requests from\n  * what resource to access (topic name, group ID, ...)\n  * the operation (read, write, ...)\n  * the permission: whether to allow or deny the above\n\nACL commands work on a multiplicative basis. If creating, specifying two\nprincipals and two permissions creates four ACLs: both permissions for the\nfirst principal, as well as both permissions for the second principal. Adding\ntwo resources further doubles the ACLs created.\n\nIt is recommended to be as specific as possible when granting ACLs. Granting\nmore ACLs than necessary per principal may inadvertently allow clients to do\nthings they should not, such as deleting topics or joining the wrong consumer\ngroup.\n\nPRINCIPALS\n\nAll ACLs require a principal. A principal is composed of two parts: the type\nand the name. Within Redpanda, only one type is supported, \"User\". The reason\nfor the prefix is that a potential future authorizer may add support for\nauthorizing by Group or anything else.\n\nWhen you create a user, you need to add ACLs for it before it can be used. You\ncan create / delete / list ACLs for that user with either \"User:bar\" or \"bar\"\nin the --allow-principal and --deny-principal flags. This command will add the\n\"User:\" prefix for you if it is missing. The wildcard '*' matches any user.\nCreating an ACL with user '*' grants or denies the permission for all users.\n\nHOSTS\n\nHosts can be seen as an extension of the principal, and effectively gate where\nthe principal can connect from. When creating ACLs, unless otherwise specified,\nthe default host is the wildcard '*' which allows or denies the principal from\nall hosts (where allow & deny are based on whether --allow-principal or\n--deny-principal is used). If specifying hosts, you must pair the --allow-host\nflag with the --allow-principal flag, and the --deny-host flag with the\n--deny-principal flag.\n\nRESOURCES\n\nA resource is what an ACL allows or denies access to. There are four resources\nwithin Redpanda: topics, groups, the cluster itself, and transactional IDs.\nNames for each of these resources can be specified with their respective flags.\n\nResources combine with the operation that is allowed or denied on that\nresource. The next section describes which operations are required for which\nrequests, and further fleshes out the concept of a resource.\n\nBy default, resources are specified on an exact name match (a \"literal\" match).\nThe --resource-pattern-type flag can be used to specify that a resource name is\n\"prefixed\", meaning to allow anything with the given prefix. A literal name of\n\"foo\" will match only the topic \"foo\", while the prefixed name of \"foo-\" will\nmatch both \"foo-bar\" and \"foo-baz\". The special wildcard resource name '*'\nmatches any name of the given resource type (--topic '*' matches all topics).\n\nOPERATIONS\n\nPairing with resources, operations are the actions that are allowed or denied.\nRedpanda has the following operations:\n\n    ALL                 Allows all operations below.\n    READ                Allows reading a given resource.\n    WRITE               Allows writing to a given resource.\n    CREATE              Allows creating a given resource.\n    DELETE              Allows deleting a given resource.\n    ALTER               Allows altering non-configurations.\n    DESCRIBE            Allows querying non-configurations.\n    DESCRIBE_CONFIGS    Allows describing configurations.\n    ALTER_CONFIGS       Allows altering configurations.\n\nCheck --help-operations to see which operations are required for which\nrequests. In flag form to set up a general producing/consuming client, you can\ninvoke 'rpk acl create' three times with the following (including your\n--allow-principal):\n\n    --operation write,read,describe --topic [topics]\n    --operation describe,read --group [group.id]\n    --operation describe,write --transactional-id [transactional.id]\n\nPERMISSIONS\n\nA client can be allowed access or denied access. By default, all permissions\nare denied. You only need to specifically deny a permission if you allow a wide\nset of permissions and then want to deny a specific permission in that set.\nYou could allow all operations, and then specifically deny writing to topics.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nCreating ACLs works on a specific ACL basis, but listing and deleting ACLs\nworks on filters. Filters allow matching many ACLs to be printed listed and\ndeleted at once. Because this can be risky for deleting, the delete command\nprompts for confirmation by default. More details and examples for creating,\nlisting, and deleting can be seen in each of the commands.\n\nUsing SASL requires setting \"enable_sasl: true\" in the redpanda section of your\nredpanda.yaml. User management is a separate, simpler concept that is\ndescribed in the user command.",

The\nprimary use of maintenance mode is to perform a rolling upgrade in which each\nnode is placed into maintenance mode prior to upgrading the node.\n\nUse the 'enable' and 'disable' subcommands to place a node into maintenance mode\nor remove it, respectively. Only one node at a time may be in maintenance mode.\n\nWhen a node is placed into maintenance mode the following occurs:\n\nLeadership draining. All raft leadership is transferred to another eligible\nnode, and the node in maintenance mode rejects new leadership requests. By\ntransferring leadership off of the node in maintenance mode all client traffic\nand requests are directed to other nodes minimizing disruption to client\nworkloads when the node is shutdown.\n\nCurrently leadership is not transferred for partitions with one replica.",

You will see a stall every time there is a violation.\n\n* Does the cluster have sufficient space? If all nodes in the cluster are\n  utilizing more than 80% of their disk space, rebalancing cannot proceed.\n\n* Do all partitions have quorum? If the majority of a partition's replicas are\n  down, the partition cannot be moved.\n\n* Are any nodes in maintenance mode? Partitions are not moved if any node is in\n  maintenance mode.",

A\nnon-group consumer consumes all records from all partitions you assign it. In\ncontrast, consumer groups allow many consumers to coordinate and divide work.\nIf you have two members in a group consuming topics A and B, each with three\npartitions, then both members consume three partitions. If you add another\nmember to the group, then each of the three members will consume two\npartitions. This allows you to horizontally scale consuming of topics.\n\nThe unit of scaling is a single partition. If you add more consumers to a group\nthan there are are total partitions to consume, then some consumers will be\nidle. More commonly, you have many more partitions than consumer group members\nand each member consumes a chunk of available partitions. One scenario where\nyou may want more members than partitions is if you want active standby's to\ntake over load immediately if any consuming member dies.\n\nHow group members divide work is entirely client driven (the \"partition\nassignment strategy\" or \"balancer\" depending on the client). Brokers know\nnothing about how consumers are assigning partitions. A broker's role in group\nconsuming is to choose which member is the leader of a group, forward that\nmember's assignment to every other member, and ensure all members are alive\nthrough heartbeats.\n\nConsumers periodically commit their progress when consuming partitions. Through\nthese commits, you can monitor just how far behind a consumer is from the\nlatest messages in a partition. This is called \"lag\". Large lag implies that\nthe client is having problems, which could be from the server being too slow,\nor the client being oversubscribed in the number of partitions it is consuming,\nor the server being in a bad state that requires restarting or removing from\nthe server pool, and so on.\n\nYou can manually manage offsets for a group, which allows you to rewind or\nforward commits. If you notice that a recent deploy of your consumers had a\nbug, you may want to stop all members, rewind the commits to before the latest\ndeploy, and restart the members with a patch.\n\nThis command allows you to list all groups, describe a group (to view the\nmembers and their lag), and manage offsets.",

Sometimes, you may need to\nrewind a group if you had a mistaken deploy, or fast-forward a group if it is\nfalling behind on messages that can be skipped.\n\nThe --to option allows you to seek to the start of partitions, end of\npartitions, or after a specific timestamp. The default is to seek any topic\npreviously committed. Using --topics allows to you set commits for only the\nspecified topics; all other commits will remain untouched. Topics with no\ncommits will not be committed unless allowed with --allow-new-topics.\n\nThe --to-group option allows you to seek to commits that are in another group.\nThis is a merging operation: if g1 is consuming topics A and B, and g2 is\nconsuming only topic B, \"rpk group seek g1 --to-group g2\" will update g1's\ncommits for topic B only. The --topics flag can be used to further narrow which\ntopics are updated. Unlike --to, all non-filtered topics are committed, even\ntopics not yet being consumed, meaning --allow-new-topics is not needed.\n\nThe --to-file option allows to seek to offsets specified in a text file with\nthe following format:\n    [TOPIC] [PARTITION] [OFFSET]\n    [TOPIC] [PARTITION] [OFFSET]\n    ...\nEach line contains the topic, the partition, and the offset to seek to. As with\nthe prior options, --topics allows filtering which topics are updated. Similar\nto --to-group, all non-filtered topics are committed, even topics not yet being\nconsumed, meaning --allow-new-topics is not needed.\n\nThe --to, --to-group, and --to-file options are mutually exclusive. If you are\nnot authorized to describe or read some topics used in a group, you will not be\nable to modify offsets for those topics.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nSeek group G to June 1st, 2021:\n    rpk group seek g --to 1622505600\n    or, rpk group seek g --to 1622505600000\n    or, rpk group seek g --to 1622505600000000000\nSeek group X to the commits of group Y topic foo:\n    rpk group seek X --to-group Y --topics foo\nSeek group G's topics foo, bar, and biz to the end:\n    rpk group seek G --to end --topics foo,bar,biz\nSeek group G to the beginning of a topic it was not previously consuming:\n    rpk group seek G --to start --topics foo --allow-new-topics",

        "description": "Consume records from topics.\n\nConsuming records reads from any amount of input topics, formats each record\naccording to --format, and prints them to STDOUT. The output formatter\nunderstands a wide variety of formats.\n\nThe default output format \"--format json\" is a special format that outputs each\nrecord as JSON. There may be more single-word-no-escapes formats added later.\nOutside of these special formats, formatting follows the rules described below.\n\nFormatting output is based on percent escapes and modifiers. Slashes can be\nused for common escapes:\n\n    \\t \\n \\r \\\\ \\xNN\n\nprints tabs, newlines, carriage returns, slashes, or hex encoded characters.p\n\nPercent encoding prints record fields, fetch partition fields, or extra values:\n\n    %t    topic\n    %T    topic length\n    %k    key\n    %K    key length\n    %v    value\n    %V    value length\n    %h    begin the header specification\n    %H    number of headers\n    %p    partition\n    %o    offset\n    %e    leader epoch\n    %d    timestamp (formatting described below)\n    %a    record attributes (formatting described below)\n    %x    producer id\n    %y    producer epoch\n\n    %[    partition log start offset\n    %|    partition last stable offset\n    %]    partition high watermark\n\n    %%    percent sign\n    %{    left brace\n    %}    right brace\n\n    %i    the number of records formatted\n\nMODIFIERS\n\nText and numbers can be formatted in many different ways, and the default\nformat can be changed within brace modifiers. %v prints a value, while %v{hex}\nprints the value hex encoded. %T prints the length of a topic in ascii, while\n%T{big8} prints the length of the topic as an eight byte big endian.\n\nAll modifiers go within braces following a percent-escape.\n\nNUMBERS\n\nFormatting number values can have the following modifiers:\n\n     ascii       print the number as ascii (default)\n\n     hex64       sixteen hex characters\n     hex32       eight hex characters\n     hex16       four hex characters\n     hex8        two hex characters\n     hex4        one hex character\n\n     big64       eight byte big endian number\n     big32       four byte big endian number\n     big16       two byte big endian number\n     big8        alias for byte\n\n     little64    eight byte little endian number\n     little32    four byte little endian number\n     little16    two byte little endian number\n     little8     alias for byte\n\n     byte        one byte number\n     bool        \"true\" if the number is non-zero, \"false\" if the number is zero\n\nAll numbers are truncated as necessary per the modifier. Printing %V{byte} for\na length 256 value will print a single null, whereas printing %V{big8} would\nprint the bytes 1 and 0.\n\nWhen writing number sizes, the size corresponds to the size of the raw values,\nnot the size of encoded values. \"%T% t{hex}\" for the topic \"foo\" will print\n\"3 666f6f\", not \"6 666f6f\".\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n\nBy default, the timestamp field is printed as a millisecond number value. In\naddition to the number modifiers above, timestamps can be printed with either\nGo formatting or strftime formatting:\n\n    %d{go[2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00]}\n    %d{strftime[%F]}\n\nAn arbitrary amount of brackets (or braces, or # symbols) can wrap your date\nformatting:\n\n    %d{strftime### [%F] ###}\n\nThe above will print \" [YYYY-MM-DD] \", while the surrounding three # on each\nside are used to wrap the formatting. Further details on Go time formatting can\nbe found at https://pkg.go.dev/time, while further details on strftime\nformatting can be read by checking \"man strftime\".\n\nATTRIBUTES\n\nEach record (or batch of records) has a set of possible attributes. Internally,\nthese are packed into bit flags. Printing an attribute requires first selecting\nwhich attribute you want to print, and then optionally specifying how you want\nit to be printed:\n\n     %a{compression}\n     %a{compression;number}\n     %a{compression;big64}\n     %a{compression;hex8}\n\nCompression is by default printed as text (\"none\", \"gzip\", ...). Compression\ncan be printed as a number with \";number\", where number is any number\nformatting option described above. No compression is 0, gzip is 1, etc.\n\n     %a{timestamp-type}\n     %a{timestamp-type;big64}\n\nThe record's timestamp type is printed as -1 for very old records (before\ntimestamps existed), 0 for client generated timestamps, and 1 for broker\ngenerated timestamps. Number formatting can be controlled with \";number\".\n\n     %a{transactional-bit}\n     %a{transactional-bit;bool}\n\nPrints 1 if the record a part of a transaction or 0 if it is not.\nNumber formatting can be controlled with \";number\".\n\n     %a{control-bit}\n     %a{control-bit;bool}\n\nPrints 1 if the record is a commit marker or 0 if it is not.\nNumber formatting can be controlled with \";number\".\n\nTEXT\n\nText fields without modifiers default to writing the raw bytes. Alternatively,\nthere are the following modifiers:\n\n    %t{hex}\n    %k{base64}\n    %v{base64raw}\n    %v{unpack[<bBhH>iIqQc.$]}\n\nThe hex modifier hex encodes the text, the base64 modifier base64 encodes the\ntext with standard encoding, and the base64raw modifier encodes the text with\nraw standard encoding. The unpack modifier has a further internal\nspecification, similar to timestamps above:\n\n    x    pad character (does not parse input)\n    <    switch what follows to little endian\n    >    switch what follows to big endian\n\n    b    signed byte\n    B    unsigned byte\n    h    int16  (\"half word\")\n    H    uint16 (\"half word\")\n    i    int32\n    I    uint32\n    q    int64  (\"quad word\")\n    Q    uint64 (\"quad word\")\n\n    c    any character\n    .    alias for c\n    s    consume the rest of the input as a string\n    $    match the end of the line (append error string if anything remains)\n\nUnpacking text can allow translating binary input into readable output. If a\nvalue is a big-endian uint32, %v will print the raw four bytes, while\n%v{unpack[>I]} will print the number in as ascii. If unpacking exhausts the\ninput before something is unpacked fully, an error message is appended to the\noutput.\n\nHEADERS\n\nHeaders are formatted with percent encoding inside of the modifier:\n\n    %h{ %k=%v{hex} }\n\nwill print all headers with a space before the key and after the value, an\nequals sign between the key and value, and with the value hex encoded. Header\nformatting actually just parses the internal format as a record format, so all\nof the above rules about %K, %V, text, and numbers apply.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nA key and value, separated by a space and ending in newline:\n    -f '%k %v\\n'\nA key length as four big endian bytes, and the key as hex:\n    -f '%K{big32}%k{hex}'\nA little endian uint32 and a string unpacked from a value:\n    -f '%v{unpack[is$]}'\n\nOFFSETS\n\nThe --offset flag allows for specifying where to begin consuming, and\noptionally, where to stop consuming.

        "description": "Produce records to a topic.\n\nProducing records reads from STDIN, parses input according to --format, and\nproduce records to Redpanda. The input formatter understands a wide variety of\nformats.\n\nParsing input operates on either sizes or on delimiters, both of which can be\nspecified in the same formatting options. If using sizes to specify something,\nthe size must come before what it is specifying. Delimiters match on an exact\ntext basis. This command will quit with an error if any input fails to match\nyour specified format.\n\nSlashes can be used for common escapes:\n\n    \\t \\n \\r \\\\ \\xNN\n\nmatches tabs, newlines, carriage returns, slashes, and hex encoded characters.\n\nPercent encoding reads into specific values of a record:\n\n    %t    topic\n    %T    topic length\n    %k    key\n    %K    key length\n    %v    value\n    %V    value length\n    %h    begin the header specification\n    %H    number of headers\n    %p    partition (if using the --partition flag)\n\nThree escapes exist to parse characters that are used to modify the previous\nescapes:\n\n    %%    percent sign\n    %{    left brace\n    %}    right brace\n\nMODIFIERS\n\nText and numbers can be read in multiple formats, and the default format can be\nchanged within brace modifiers. %v reads a value, while %v{hex} reads a value\nand then hex decodes it before producing. %T reads the length of a topic from\nthe input, while %T{3} reads exactly three bytes for a topic from the input.\n\nAll modifiers go within braces following a percent-escape.\n\nNUMBERS\n\nReading number values can have the following modifiers:\n\n     ascii       parse numeric digits until a non-numeric (default)\n\n     hex64       sixteen hex characters\n     hex32       eight hex characters\n     hex16       four hex characters\n     hex8        two hex characters\n     hex4        one hex character\n\n     big64       eight byte big endian number\n     big32       four byte big endian number\n     big16       two byte big endian number\n     big8        alias for byte\n\n     little64    eight byte little endian number\n     little32    four byte little endian number\n     little16    two byte little endian number\n     little8     alias for byte\n\n     byte        one byte number\n     <digits>    directly specify the length as this many digits\n     bool        read \"true\" as 1, \"false\" as 0\n\nWhen reading number sizes, the size corresponds to the size of the encoded\nvalues, not the decoded values. \"%T{6}%t{hex}\" will read six hex bytes and\ndecode into three.\n\nTEXT\n\nReading text values can have the following modifiers:\n\n    hex       read text then hex decode it\n    base64    read text then std-encoding base64 decode it\n    re        read text matching a regular expression\n\nHEADERS\n\nHeaders are parsed with an internal key / value specifier format. For example,\nthe following will read three headers that begin and end with a space and are\nseparated by an equal:\n\n    %H{3}%h{ %k=%v }\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nIn the below examples, we can parse many records at once. The produce command\nreads input and tokenizes based on your specified format. Every time the format\nis completely matched, a record is produced and parsing begins anew.\n\nA key and value, separated by a space and ending in newline:\n    -f '%k %v\\n'\nA four byte topic, four byte key, and four byte value:\n    -f '%T{4}%K{4}%V{4}%t%k%v'\nA value to a specific partition, if using a non-negative --partition flag:\n    -f '%p %v\\n'\nA big-endian uint16 key size, the text \" foo \", and then that key:\n    -f '%K{big16} foo %k'\nA value that can be two or three characters followed by a newline:\n    -f '%v{re#...?#}\\n'\n\nMISC\n\nProducing requires a topic to produce to. The topic can be specified either\ndirectly on as an argument, or in the input text through %t. A parsed topic\ntakes precedence over the default passed in topic. If no topic is specified\ndirectly and no topic is parsed, this command will quit with an error.\n\nThe input format can parse partitions to produce directly to with %p. Doing so\nrequires specifying a non-negative --partition flag. Any parsed partition\ntakes precedence over the --partition flag; specifying the flag is the main\nrequirement for being able to directly control which partition to produce to.\n\nYou can also specify an output format to write when a record is produced\nsuccessfully. The output format follows the same formatting rules as the topic\nconsume command. See that command's help text for a detailed description.",
