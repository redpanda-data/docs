Generate Grafana dashboards for Redpanda metrics.

Use this command to generate sample Grafana dashboards for Redpanda metrics. 
These dashboards can be imported into a Grafana or Grafana Cloud instance.

To select a specific dashboard, use the `--dashboard` flag followed by the 
dashboard name. For example, to generate the operations dashboard, run:

```
rpk generate grafana-dashboard --dashboard operations
```

The selected dashboard will be downloaded from Redpanda Data's [observability GitHub repository](https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability).

:::note
The legacy dashboard is still available as an option (`legacy`), but it isn't downloaded from GitHub. Instead, the generated dashboard is based on which metrics endpoint is used (`--metrics-endpoint`).
:::

### Available dashboards

You can select one of the following dashboard types:

<!--
[cols=",",]
|===
|*Name* |*Description*

|consumer-metrics |Allows for monitoring of Java Kafka consumers, using
the Prometheus JMX Exporter and the Kafka Sample Configuration.

|consumer-offsets |Metrics and KPIs that provide details of topic
consumers and how far they are lagging behind the end of the log.

|operations [default] |Provides an overview of KPIs for a Redpanda
cluster with health indicators. This is suitable for ops or SRE to
monitor on a daily or continuous basis.

|topic-metrics |Provides throughput, read/write rates, and on-disk sizes
of each/all topics.

|legacy |Generates dashboard based on selected metrics endpoint
(--metrics-endpoint). Modify prometheus datasource and job-name with
--datasource and --job-name flags.
