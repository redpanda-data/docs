This topic explains Redpanda's tips and recommendations for Kubernetes deployments.

## Deploy at least three Pod replicas

Redpanda recommends at least three Pod replicas (Redpanda brokers) to use as _seed servers_. Seed servers are used to bootstrap the gossip process for new brokers joining a cluster. When a new broker joins, it connects to the seed servers to find out the topology of the Redpanda cluster. A larger number of seed servers makes consensus more robust and minimizes the chance of unwanted clusters forming when brokers are restarted without any data.

By default, the Helm chart deploys a StatefulSet with three Redpanda brokers. You can specify the number of Redpanda brokers in the `statefulset.replicas` configuration.

## Use PersistentVolumes

Redpanda recommends using PersistentVolumes that are backed by NVMe SSD disks.
For scalability, it's best to use a StorageClass with a dynamic provisioner.
Dynamic provisioners make it easier to scale your Redpanda clusters because they provision new volumes when new Redpanda brokers are added to the cluster.
Without a dynamic provisioner, you would need to create each PersistentVolume manually in order to bind it to the corresponding PersistentVolumeClaim.

PersistentVolumes should be one of the following types:

| **PersistentVolume** | **Description** | **Best Use** |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------|
|   [Local](#local-persistentvolumes) (recommended) |   Storage is located on the worker node   |   High throughput and low latency  |
|   [Remote](#remote-storage) |   Storage is mounted to the node through the network |  High availability   |

Local PersistentVolumes can be accessed only by the worker nodes to which they are physically connected. To delay the binding of the PersistentVolumeClaim until the Pod is scheduled, set `volumeBindingMode` to `WaitForFirstConsumer` on the StorageClass.

PersistentVolumeClaims are not deleted when Redpanda brokers are removed from a cluster.
It is your responsibility to delete PersistentVolumeClaims when they are no longer needed.
As a result, it's important to consider your volume’s reclaim policy when creating your StorageClass:

- `Delete` - The volume is deleted when you delete the PersistentVolumeClaim.
- `Reclaim` - The volume is not deleted when you delete the PersistentVolumeClaim, allowing you to reclaim it with a new PersistentVolumeClaim.

Learn [how to configure storage in the Helm chart](../../../../../manage/kubernetes/configure-storage).

### Local PersistentVolumes

Local PersistentVolumes store Redpanda data on a local disk that's attached to the worker node. Redpanda reads and writes data faster on a local disk.
However, local disks are tied to the lifecycle of the worker node.
If the worker node fails for any reason, you may lose access to the Redpanda data.

Because Redpanda uses the Raft protocol to replicate data, it is safe to store data on local disks as long as your Redpanda cluster consists of the following:

- At least three brokers
- Topics configured with a replication factor of at least 3

This way, even if a worker node fails and you lose its local disk, the data still exists on at least two other worker nodes.

:::tip
For greater reliability, Redpanda recommends enabling [rack awareness](../../../../../manage/kubernetes/kubernetes-rack-awareness) to minimize data loss in the event of a rack failure.
:::

Redpanda recommends the [Rancher Local Path Provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner), which provides a dynamic provisioner for local volumes.

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: local-path
provisioner: rancher.io/local-path
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

### Remote storage

Remote storage persists data outside of the worker node so that the data is not tied to a specific worker node and it can be recovered.

To avoid losing Redpanda brokers in cloud deployments, it's best to host your remote storage in the same availability zone as the Pods that are running the Redpanda brokers. This way, if an availability zone suffers an outage, any Redpanda brokers outside of that availability zone do not lose access to their remote storage and can continue running.

<TabItem value="aws" label="Amazon AWS">

Redpanda recommends the `io2` or `gp3` volume types due to their performance characteristics. For details about Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volume types, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html#vol-type-ssd).

If you use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and you want to use EBS, make sure to install the [Amazon EBS CSI driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/ebs-csi.html). This driver is required to allow EKS to create PersistentVolumes.

Redpanda recommends the Balance PD, Performance (PD-SSD), or Extreme PD disk types due to their performance characteristics. For details about Google persistent disks, see the [Google documentation](https://cloud.google.com/persistent-disk#section-5).

## Use a NodePort Service for external networking

Redpanda recommends using a NodePort Service to expose worker nodes and to give external clients access to the Redpanda brokers running on them.
The NodePort Service provides the lowest latency of all the Services because it does not include any unnecessary routing or middleware.
Client connections go to the Redpanda brokers in the most direct way possible, through the worker nodes.

Depending on your deployment and security policies, you may not be able to access worker nodes through a NodePort Service.
If you choose to use another Service, consider the impact on the cost and performance of your deployment:

- LoadBalancer Service - To make each Redpanda broker accessible with LoadBalancer Services, you need one LoadBalancer Service for each Redpanda broker so that requests can be routed to specific brokers rather than balancing requests across all brokers. Load balancers are expensive, add latency and occasional packet loss, and add an unnecessary layer of complexity.

- Ingress - To make each Redpanda broker accessible with Ingress, you need to run an Ingress controller and set up routing to each Redpanda broker. Routing adds latency and can be a throughput bottleneck.

See [Networking and Connectivity](../../../../../manage/kubernetes/networking/networking-and-connectivity).

## Use ExternalDNS for external access

Redpanda recommends using ExternalDNS to manage DNS records for your Pods' domains. ExternalDNS synchronizes exposed Kubernetes Services with various DNS providers, rendering Kubernetes resources accessible through DNS servers.

Benefits of ExternalDNS include:

- **Automation**: ExternalDNS automatically configures public DNS records when you create, update, or delete Kubernetes Services or Ingresses. This eliminates the need for manual DNS configuration which can be error-prone.

- **Compatibility**: ExternalDNS is compatible with a wide range of DNS providers, including major cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, and DNS servers like CoreDNS and PowerDNS.

- **Integration with other tools**: ExternalDNS can be used in conjunction with other Kubernetes tools, such as ingress controllers or cert-manager for managing TLS certificates.

You can use ExternalDNS with the default [NodePort Service](../../../../../manage/kubernetes/networking/configure-external-access-nodeport#externaldns) and [LoadBalancer Services](../../../../../manage/kubernetes/networking/configure-external-access-loadbalancer#externaldns).

## Secure your cluster

To protect your Kubernetes cluster, do the following:

- Deploy Redpanda in a separate namespace to protect your data from other resources in your Kubernetes cluster.

  ```bash
  kubectl create namespace redpanda
  ```

- If you're using a cloud platform, use [IAM roles](../../../../../manage/security/iam-roles) to restrict access to resources in your cluster.

To protect your Redpanda cluster, enable and configure the following security features in the Helm chart:

- [Authentication through SASL](../../../../../manage/kubernetes/security/sasl-kubernetes)
- [Network encryption through TLS](../../../../../manage/kubernetes/security/kubernetes-tls)

## Set resource requests and limits for memory and CPU

In a production cluster, the resources you allocate to Redpanda should be proportionate to your machine type. Redpanda recommends that you determine and set these values before deploying the cluster, but you can also update the values on a running cluster.

:::info
In a running Redpanda cluster, you cannot decrease the number of CPU cores. You can only increase the number of CPU cores.
:::

Redpanda recommends that you allocate the following memory and CPU resources:

- At least 4 CPU cores.

- At least 2GiB (2Gi) of memory per core for Redpanda.

- Memory `min` and `max` configurations set to the same values.

  Setting the `min` and `max` configurations to the same values makes sure that Kubernetes assigns a `Guaranteed` Quality of Service (QoS) class to your Pods. Kubernetes uses QoS classes to decide which Pods to evict from a node that runs out of resources. When a node runs out of resources, Kubernetes evicts Pods with a `Guaranteed` QoS last. For more details about QoS, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/#create-a-pod-that-gets-assigned-a-qos-class-of-guaranteed).

For example:

```yaml
resources:
  cpu:
    cores: 4
  memory:
    container:
      min: 8Gi
      max: 8Gi
```

:::tip
If you omit the `resources.memory.container.min` configuration, it is set to the same value as the `resources.memory.container.max` configuration.
:::

To determine how many resources are available on your worker nodes, run:

```bash
kubectl describe nodes
```
