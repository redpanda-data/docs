Redpanda Console is a developer-friendly web UI for managing and debugging your Redpanda cluster and your applications.

In this step, you use port-forwarding to access Redpanda Console on your local network.

:::info
Because you're using the Community Edition of Redpanda Console, you should not expose Redpanda Console outside your local network. The Community Edition of Redpanda Console does not provide authentication, and it connects to the Redpanda cluster as superuser. To use the Enterprise Edition, you need a license key, see [Redpanda Licensing](../../../../../get-started/licenses).
:::

1. Expose Redpanda Console to your localhost:

  ```bash
  kubectl --namespace <namespace> port-forward svc/redpanda-console 8080:8080
  ```

  <details>
  <summary>
  Example output
  </summary>

  ```text
  Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8080
  Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 8080
  ```

  </details>
  
  The `kubectl port-forward` command actively runs in the command-line window. To execute other commands while the command is running, open another command-line window.

1. Open Redpanda Console on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

  All your Redpanda brokers are listed along with their IP addresses and IDs.

1. Go to **Topics** > **twitch_chat**.

  The message that you produced to the topic is displayed along with some other details about the topic.

1. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> in the command-line to stop the port-forwarding process.
