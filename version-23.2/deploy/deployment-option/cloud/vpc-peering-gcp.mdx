To start sending data to the Redpanda cluster, you must configure the VPC network connection by connecting your Redpanda VPC to your existing GCP VPC.


### Prerequisites

* A GCP account 
* A running BYOC cluster in GCP. See [Create a BYOC Cluster on GCP](create-byoc-cluster-gcp.mdx).
* Your Redpanda cluster and VPC must be in the same region.

## Create VPCs 
 
1. Go to the **VPC** section in your GCP project UI. 
2. You should see an existing VPC. This has an ID with a `redpanda-` prefix. 
3. If you don't already have a second VPC to connect your Redpanda network to, create one. 
    
    * This is your Redpanda client. Ensure that its CIDR does not overlap with the Redpanda network from step 1. 
    * The following example uses the name `rp-client`.  

## Create a new peering connection 

1. In the GCP project UI, go to **Peering Connections**. 

2. Create a new peering connection with the following values:
    * Your VPC network: `rp-client`
    * Peered VPC network: `redpanda-<id>`
    
3. Save changes.

4. Create another peering connection, with the reverse values as above: 
    * Your VPC network: `redpanda-<id>`
    * Peered VPC network: `rp-client`
    
5. Save changes. GCP should set up routing automatically. 

## Connect to Redpanda​

The cluster Overview page has a variety of ways for you to connect and start sending data. 

To quickly test this quickly in GCP: 
* Create a virtual machine on your GCP network that has a firewall rule allowing ingress traffic from your IP (for example, `<your-ip>/32`)
* Activate the Cloud Shell in your project, install `rpk` in the Cloud Shell, and run `rpk cluster info`.
* If there is output from Redpanda, your connection is successful.
