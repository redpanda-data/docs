Learn about follower fetching and how to configure a Redpanda consumer to fetch records from the closest replica.

## About follower fetching

**Follower fetching** enables a consumer to fetch records from the closest replica of a topic partition, regardless of whether it's a leader or a follower.

For a Redpanda cluster deployed across different datacenters and availability zones, restricting a consumer to fetch only from the leader of a partition can incur more costs and have higher latency than fetching from a follower that is geographically closer to the consumer. 

With follower fetching (proposed in [KIP-392](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-392%3A+Allow+consumers+to+fetch+from+closest+replica)), the fetch protocol is extended to support a consumer fetching from any replica. 

The first fetch from a consumer is processed by a Redpanda leader node. The leader checks for a replica (itself or a follower) that has a rack ID that matches the consumer's rack ID. If a replica with a matching rack ID is found, the fetch request returns records from that replica. Otherwise, the fetch is handled by the leader.

## Configure follower fetching

Redpanda decides which replica a consumer fetches from. If the consumer configures its `client.rack` property, Redpanda by default selects a replica from the same rack as the consumer, if available.

To enable follower fetching in Redpanda, configure properties for the consumer and the Redpanda cluster and node:

- For a Redpanda cluster, set the [`enable_rack_awareness`](../../../reference/cluster-properties#enable_rack_awareness) property to `true`.
- For each Redpanda node, set the [`rack`](../../../reference/node-properties#rack) property to a rack ID. 
- For each consumer, set the `client.rack` property to a rack ID.
