Create a basic chat room application with Redpanda Cloud and Kafka clients developed with [kafkajs](https://kafka.js.org/).

<Intro/>

## Prerequisites

[Install Node.js for your platform](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

:::note
Redpanda Cloud environments use certificates signed by
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). Most programming languages will
load their root certificate authority (CA), `ISRG Root X1`, by default so you
shouldn't need to provide a custom CA.
:::

## Set up Redpanda Cloud

<SetUpCloud frontmatter={frontMatter}/>

## Set up your environment

1. Create and set your working directory to the project folder, `chat-room`:

   ```bash
   mkdir chat-room
   cd chat-room
   ```

2. Generate the `package.json` file:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm i -D typescript
   npm i -D @types/node
   npm i kafkajs
   npm i uuid
   npm i -D @types/uuid
   ```

4. Generate a `tsconfig.json` file:

   ```bash
   node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --init
   ```

5. In `chat-room/`, create a `src/` directory for source files:

    ```bash
    mkdir src
    ```

## Create a topic

You need a topic named `chat-room` for both Redpanda and the client to use to store chat room messages. If you completed the Redpanda Quickstart, this topic already exists in your cluster.

1. Verify that the `chat-room` topic exists in your cluster by listing all topics:

  ```bash
  rpk topic list --tls-enabled
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  NAME       PARTITIONS  REPLICAS
  chat-room  1           1
  ```

1. If the topic doesn't exist yet, use [rpk](../../reference/rpk) to create a `chat-room` topic:

  ```bash
  rpk topic create chat-room --tls-enabled
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  TOPIC      STATUS
  chat-room  OK
  ```

## Confirm that the topic exists on the client side

The client may not always know that the topic exists. You can verify that it exists and create it if not. In `chat-room/` create a source file called `src/admin.ts` with the following content.

Replace the placeholders with the same values that you used in the Redpanda Cloud Quickstart.

```javascript title="src/admin.ts"
import { Kafka } from "kafkajs";

const redpanda = new Kafka({
  brokers: ["<bootstrap-server-address>"],
  ssl: {
    },
  sasl: {
    mechanism: "scram-sha-256",
    username: "redpanda-chat-account",
    password: "<password>"
  }
});
const admin = redpanda.admin();

export async function createTopic(
  topic: string,
  partitions?: number,
  replicas?: number
) {
  await admin.connect();
  const existingTopics = await admin.listTopics();

  if (!existingTopics.includes(topic)) {
    await admin.createTopics({
      topics: [
        {
          topic: topic,
          numPartitions: partitions ? partitions : 1,
          replicationFactor: replicas ? replicas : 1,
        },
      ],
    });
  }

  await admin.disconnect();
}
```

## Create a producer

A client needs a producer to publish `chat-room` topic messages.

To create a producer for the client, in `chat-room/` create a source file `src/producer.ts` with the following content.

Replace the placeholders with the same values that you used in the Redpanda Cloud Quickstart.

```javascript title="src/producer.ts"
import { Kafka } from "kafkajs";

const redpanda = new Kafka({
  brokers: ["<bootstrap-server-address>"],
  ssl: {
    },
  sasl: {
    mechanism: "scram-sha-256",
    username: "redpanda-chat-account",
    password: "<password>"
  }
});
const producer = redpanda.producer();

export async function getConnection(user: string) {
  try {
    await producer.connect();
    return async (message: string) => {
      await producer.send({
        topic: "chat-room",
        messages: [{ value: JSON.stringify({ message, user }) }],
      });
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}

export async function disconnect() {
  try {
    await producer.disconnect();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}
```

You now have a working producer that sends strings entered by the user to the
`chat-room` topic. Messages are sent as JSON encoded strings here,
but keep in mind that the producer only sends buffers, so you can encode the
messages however you like.

## Create a consumer

A client needs a consumer to receive `chat-room` topic messages.

To create a consumer for the client, in `chat-room/` create a source file `src/consumer.ts` with the following content.

Replace the placeholders with the same values that you used in the Redpanda Cloud Quickstart.

```javascript title="src/consumer.ts"
import { Kafka } from "kafkajs";
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from "uuid";

const redpanda = new Kafka({
  brokers: ["<bootstrap-server-address>"],
  ssl: {
    },
  sasl: {
    mechanism: "scram-sha-256",
    username: "redpanda-chat-account",
    password: "<password>"
  }
});
const consumer = redpanda.consumer({ groupId: uuidv4() });

export async function connect() {
  try {
    await consumer.connect();
    await consumer.subscribe({ topic: "chat-room" });
    await consumer.run({
      eachMessage: async ({ topic, partition, message }) => {
        const formattedValue = JSON.parse(
          (message.value as Buffer).toString()
        );
        console.log(`${formattedValue.user}: ${formattedValue.message}`);
      },
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}

export async function disconnect() {
  try {
    await consumer.disconnect();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}
```

You now have a consumer that reads all messages from the `chat-room`
topic and prints them to the console. You can start as many consumer groups as
you like, but remember that each group reads a message only once, which is
why the example is using a generated UUID for the group ID.

:::note
Because the `eachMessage()` function automatically commits on a heartbeat interval, there is no `commit()` method or auto-commit configuration in the code.
:::

## Create a client application

The client needs an application that creates the topic, producer, and consumer and implements the chat logic.

To create a client application, in `chat-room/` create a source file `src/index.ts` with the following content.

```javascript title="src/index.ts"
import * as readline from "node:readline";
import * as Admin from "./admin";
import * as Producer from "./producer";
import * as Consumer from "./consumer";

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
});

async function start() {
  const topic = "chat-room";
  console.log(`Creating topic: ${topic}`);
  await Admin.createTopic(topic);
  console.log("Connecting...");
  await Consumer.connect();

  rl.question("Enter user name: \n", async function (username) {
    const sendMessage = await Producer.getConnection(username);
    if (sendMessage) {
      console.log("Connected, press Ctrl+C to exit");
      rl.on("line", (input) => {
        readline.moveCursor(process.stdout, 0, -1);
        sendMessage(input);
      });
    } else {
      console.error("Failed to initialize sendMessage function");
    }
  });
}

start();

process.on("SIGINT", async () => {
  console.log('Closing app...');

  try {
    await Producer.disconnect();
    await Consumer.disconnect();
    rl.close();
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error during cleanup:', err);
    process.exit(1);
  } finally {
    console.log('Cleanup finished. Exiting');
    process.exit(0);
  }
});
```

## Build and run the application

Build the client chat application, run it from multiple client terminals, and chat between the clients.

1. From `chat-room/`, build the client application:

  ```bash
  node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc src/index.ts
  ```

1. Open at least two terminals, and for each terminal:

    1. Run the client application:

      ```
      node src/index.js
      ```

    1. When prompted with `Enter user name:`, enter a unique name for the chat room.

1. Use the chat application: enter a message in a terminal, and verify that the message is received in the other terminals.

  For example:

  ```
  Enter user name:
  Alice
  Connected, press Ctrl+C to exit
  Alice: Hi, I'm Alice
  Bob: Hi Alice, I'm Bob, nice to meet you
  ```
