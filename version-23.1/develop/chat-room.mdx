Learn why Redpanda is ideal for building chat room applications and how to do it with your chosen Kafka client library.

## What is a chat room application?

A chat room application is software that enables users to engage in real-time textual communication with one another. These applications typically allow multiple users to join a chat room, where they can send messages and interact with others in a group conversation.

Chat room applications often include features such as private messaging, user profiles, and notifications. Some popular chat room applications include Slack, Discord, and WhatsApp.

## Why use Redpanda?

Redpanda offers several features that make it ideal for building a fast, scalable, and robust chat room application.

- Scalability: Redpanda can scale horizontally and vertically to accommodate growing chat room usage over time.

- Low-latency: Redpanda is designed for minimal latency to provide a smooth user experience and fast message delivery.

- Fault tolerance: Redpanda is resilient to failures, thanks to its built-in replication and partitioning capabilities. This built-in resilience ensures that the chat room application continues to serve users even if individual brokers in the cluster experience downtime.

- Durability: Redpanda persists messages on disk, maintaining chat history and allowing users to read previous conversations.

## Build the application

Redpanda is compatible with Kafka client libraries developed for Kafka versions 0.11 or later. Follow one of these tutorials to build a basic chat room application in your chosen language:

- [Go](../guide-go)
- [Java](../guide-java)
- [Node.js](../guide-nodejs)
- [Python](../guide-python)
