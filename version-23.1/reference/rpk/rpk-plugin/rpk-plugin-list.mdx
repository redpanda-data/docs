List all available plugins.

By default, this command fetches the remote manifest and prints plugins
available for download. Any plugin that is already downloaded is prefixed with
an asterisk. If a locally installed plugin has a different `SHA-256 SUM` as the one
specified in the manifest, or if the `SHA-256 SUM` could not be calculated for the
local plugin, an additional message is printed.

You can specify `--local` to print all locally installed plugins, as well as
whether you have "shadowed" plugins (the same plugin specified multiple times).

## Usage

```bash
rpk plugin list [flags]
```
