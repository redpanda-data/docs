Uninstall the BYOC plugin.

This command deletes your locally downloaded BYOC managed plugin if it exists.
Often, you only need to download the plugin to create your cluster once, and
then you never need the plugin again. You can uninstall to save a small bit of
disk space.

## Usage

```bash
rpk cloud byoc uninstall [flags]
```
