Delete ACLs.

See the `rpk acl` help text for a full write up on ACLs. Delete flags work in a
similar multiplying effect as creating ACLs, but delete is more advanced:
deletion works on a filter basis. Any unspecified flag defaults to matching
everything (all operations, or all allowed principals, etc). To ensure that you
do not accidentally delete more than you intend, this command prints everything
that matches your input filters and prompts for a confirmation before the
delete request is issued. Anything matching more than 10 ACLs doubly confirms.

As mentioned, not specifying flags matches everything. If no resources are
specified, all resources are matched. If no operations are specified, all
operations are matched. You can also opt in to matching everything with "any":
--operation any matches any operation.

The --resource-pattern-type, defaulting to "any", configures how to filter
resource names:

- "any" returns exact name matches of either prefixed or literal pattern type
- "match" returns wildcard matches, prefix patterns that match your input, and literal matches
- "prefix" returns prefix patterns that match your input (prefix "fo" matches "foo")
- "literal" returns exact name matches

## Usage
