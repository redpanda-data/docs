Decommission the given broker.

Decommissioning a broker removes it from the cluster.

A decommission request is sent to every broker in the cluster, only the cluster
leader handles the request.

:::note
For safety on v22.x clusters, this command will not run if the requested
broker is in maintenance mode. As of v23.x, Redpanda supports
decommissioning a node that is currently in maintenance mode. If you are on
a v22.x cluster and need to bypass the maintenance mode check (perhaps your
cluster is unreachable), use the hidden `--force` flag.

rpk redpanda admin brokers decommission [BROKER ID] [flags]
