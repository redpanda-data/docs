This section provides reference descriptions about the internal metrics exported from Redpanda's `/metrics` endpoint.

<MetricsUsageTip/>

:::important
In a live system, Redpanda metrics are exported only for features that are in use. For example, a metric for consumer groups is not exported when no groups are registered. 

To see the available internal metrics in your system, query the `/metrics` endpoint:

```bash
curl http://<node-addr>:9644/metrics | grep "[HELP|TYPE]"
```

## Internal metrics

Most internal metrics are useful for debugging. The following subset of internal metrics can be useful to monitor system health.

### vectorized_application_uptime

Redpanda uptime in milliseconds.

--- 

### vectorized_cluster_partition_last_stable_offset

Last stable offset.

If this is the last record received by the cluster, then the cluster is up-to-date and ready for maintenance.

---

### vectorized_io_queue_delay

Total delay time in the queue.

Can indicate latency caused by disk operations in seconds.

---

### vectorized_io_queue_queue_length

Number of requests in the queue. 

Can indicate latency caused by disk operations.

---

### vectorized_kafka_rpc_active_connections

Number of currently active Kafka RPC connections, or clients.

---

### vectorized_kafka_rpc_connects

Number of accepted Kafka RPC connections.

Compare to the value at a previous time to derive the rate of accepted connections.

---

### vectorized_kafka_rpc_received_bytes

Number of bytes received from Kafka RPC clients in valid requests.

Compare to the value at a previous time to derive the throughput in Kafka layer in bytes/sec received.

---

### vectorized_kafka_rpc_requests_completed 

Number of successful Kafka RPC requests.

Compare to the value at a previous time to derive the messages per second per shard.

---

### vectorized_kafka_rpc_requests_pending

Number of Kafka RPC requests being processed by a server.

---

### vectorized_kafka_rpc_sent_bytes

Number of bytes sent to Kafka RPC clients.

---

### vectorized_kafka_rpc_service_errors

Number of Kafka RPC service errors.

---

### vectorized_raft_leadership_changes

Number of leadership changes.

High value can indicate nodes failing and causing leadership changes.

---

### vectorized_reactor_utilization

Redpanda process utilization. 

Shows the true utilization of the CPU by a Redpanda process.

---

### vectorized_storage_log_compacted_segment

Number of compacted segments.

---

### vectorized_storage_log_log_segments_created

Number of created log segments.

---

### vectorized_storage_log_partition_size

Current size of partition in bytes.

---

### vectorized_storage_log_read_bytes

Total number of bytes read.

---
### vectorized_storage_log_written_bytes

Total number of bytes written.
