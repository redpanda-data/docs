You can use the MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint connector to import consumer group offsets
from other Kafka clusters.

## Prerequisites

- The external Kafka cluster is accessible.
- A service account with read-only access to the external cluster is available.
- The Kafka cluster topics connector is running for the same source cluster, with a matching configuration.

## Create a MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint Source connector

To create the MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint Source connector:

1. In Redpanda Cloud, click **Connectors** in the navigation menu, and then
   click **Create Connector**.
2. Select **Import from Kafka cluster offsets**.
3. On the **Create Connector** page, specify the following required connector
   configuration options:

   | Property                             | Description |
   | ------------------------------------ | ----------- |
   | `Topics to replicate`  | Comma-separated topic names and regexes you want to replicate. |
   | `Source cluster broker list`  | A comma-separated list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of all servers regardless of which servers are specified here for bootstrapping.
   | `Source cluster security protocol` | The protocol used to communicate with source brokers. The default is `PLAINTEXT`. |
   | `Groups` | Consumer groups to replicate. Supports comma-separated group IDs and regexes. |
   | `Connector name` | Globally-unique name to use for this connector. |
4. Click **Next**. Review the connector properties specified, then click **Create**.

### Advanced MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint Source connector configuration

In most instances, the preceding basic configuration properties are sufficient.
If you require additional property settings, then specify any of the following
_optional_ advanced connector configuration properties by selecting **Show advanced options**
on the **Create Connector** page:

| Property                     | Description |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| `Source cluster SSL custom certificate` | Trusted certificates in the PEM format. |
| `Source cluster SSL keystore key` | Private key in the PEM format. |
| `Source cluster SSL keystore certificate chain` | Certificate chain in the PEM format. |
| `Topics exclude` | Excluded topics. Supports comma-separated topic names and regexes. |
| `Source cluster alias` | When using DefaultReplicationPolicy, topic names will be prefixed with it. |
| `Replication policy class` | Class that defines the remote topic naming convention. Use IdentityReplicationPolicy to preserve topic names. DefaultReplicationPolicy prefixes the topic with the source cluster alias. |
| `Emit checkpoints interval seconds` | Frequency of checkpoints. The default is `60`. |
| `Sync group offsets enabled` | Specifies whether or not to periodically write the translated offsets to the __consumer_offsets topic in the target cluster, as long as no active consumers in that group are connected to the target cluster. |
| `Sync group offsets interval seconds` | Frequency of consumer group offset sync. The default is `60`. |
| `Refresh groups interval seconds` | Frequency of group refreshes. The default is `600`. |
| `Offset-Syncs topic location` | The location (`source` or `target`) of the offset-syncs topic. The default is `source`. |
| `Checkpoints topic replication factor` | Replication factor for checkpoints topic. The dfault is `-1`. |

## Test the connection

After the connector is created:

- Ensure that there are no errors in logs and in Redpanda Console.
- Wait for the Kafka cluster topics connector to catch up. Then check to confirm that the consumer groups are replicated.

## Troubleshoot

Most MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint Source connector issues are reported as a failed task at the
time of creation.

| Message | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Connection to node -1 (/127.0.0.1:9092) could not be established. Broker may not be available. / LOGS: Timed out while checking for or creating topic 'mm2-offset-syncs.target.internal'. This could indicate a connectivity issue / TimeoutException: Timed out waiting for a node assignment** | Make sure broker URLs are correct and that the source cluster security protocol is correct. |
| **SaslAuthenticationException: SASL authentication failed: security: Invalid credentials** | Check to confirm that the username and password specified are correct. |
| **java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No serviceName defined in either JAAS or Kafka config** | Check to confirm that the username and password specified are correct. |
| **Client SASL mechanism 'PLAIN' not enabled in the server, enabled mechanisms are [SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-512]** | Check to confirm that the respective `Source cluster SASL mechanism` is correct. |
| **SaslAuthenticationException: SASL authentication failed: security: Invalid credentials** | Make sure the respective `Source cluster SASL mechanism` is correct (for example, SCRAM-SHA-256 instead of SCRAM-SHA-512). |
| **terminated during authentication. This may happen due to any of the following reasons: (1) Authentication failed due to invalid credentials with brokers older than 1.0.0, (2) Firewall blocking Kafka TLS traffic (eg it may only allow HTTPS traffic), (3) Transient network issue** | Enable the SSL using `Source cluster security protocol` (specify `SSL` or `SASL_SSL`). |
