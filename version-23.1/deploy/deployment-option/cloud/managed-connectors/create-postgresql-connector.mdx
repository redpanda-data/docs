You can use a PostgreSQL (Debezium) Source connector to import updates to Redpanda from PostgreSQL.

## Prerequisites

Before you can create a PostgreSQL (Debezium) Source connector in the Redpanda Cloud, you
must:

- [Make the PostgreSQL (Debezium) database accessible](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/postgresql.html#postgresql-security)
  from connectors instance.
- [Create a PostgreSQL (Debezium) user](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/postgresql.html#postgresql-permissions)
  with the necessary permissions.

## Limitations

The PostgreSQL (Debezium) Source connector has the following limitations:

- Only `JSON`, `CloudEvents` or `AVRO` formats can be used for a Kafka message key and value format.
- PostgreSQL (Debezium) connector can work with only a single task at a time.

## Create a PostgreSQL (Debezium) Source connector

To create the PostgreSQL (Debezium) Source connector:

1. In Redpanda Cloud, click **Connectors** in the navigation menu, and then
   click **Create Connector**.
2. Select **Import from PostgreSQL (Debezium)**.
3. On the **Create Connector** page, specify the following required connector
   configuration options:

   | Property                             | Description |
   | ------------------------------------ | ----------- |
   | `Topic prefix`                       | A topic prefix that identifies and provides a namespace for the particular database server/cluster that is capturing changes. The topic prefix should be unique across all other connectors because it is used as a prefix for all Kafka topic names that receive events emitted by this connector. Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, dots, and underscores are accepted. |
   | `Hostname`                           | A resolvable hostname or IP address of the PostgreSQL database server. |
   | `Port`                               | Integer port number of the PostgreSQL database server. |
   | `User`                               | Name of the PostgreSQL user to be used when connecting to the PostgreSQL database. |
   | `Password`                           | The password of the PostgreSQL database user who will be connecting to the PostgreSQL database. |
   | `Database`                           | The name of the database from which the connector will import changes. |
   | `SSL mode`                           | Specifies whether to use an encrypted connection to the PostgreSQL server. Select `disable` to use an unencrypted connection. Select `require` to use a secure, or encrypted connection. If a secure connection cannot be established when `required` is selected, then the connector fails.  |
   | `Kafka message key format`           | Format of the key in the Kafka topic. |
   | `Message key JSON contains schema`   | Enable to specify that the message key contains schema in the schema field. |
   | `Kafka message value format`         | Format of the value in the Kafka topic. |
   | `Message value JSON contains schema` | Enable to specify that the message value contains schema in the schema field. |
   | `Connector name`                     | Globally-unique name to use for this connector. |
4. Click **Next**. Review the connector properties specified, then click **Create**.

## Map data

Use the appropriate key or value converter (input data format) for your data as follows:

- Use `Include Schemas`, `Include Tables` and `Include Columns` properties to define
  lists of columns, tables, and schemas to read from. Alternatively, use `Exclude Schemas`,
  `Exclude Tables`, and `Exclude Columns` to define lists of columns, tables, and
  schemas to exclude from sources list.

- Use only `JSON`, `AVRO` and `CloudEvents` formats for the Kafka message key and value format.

## Test the connection

After the connector is created:

1. Open Redpanda Console, click the **Topics** tab and select a topic.
   Check to check to confirm that it contains data migrated from PostgreSQL.
   Alternatively, use the `rpk consume` to check the topic.

2. Click the **Connectors** tab to confirm no issues have been reported for the
   connector.

## Troubleshoot

If the connector configuration is invalid, an error appears upon clicking **Finish**.

Additional errors and corrective actions follow.

| Message | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Missing tables or topics** | The Debezium connector replicates tables one by one. Wait for other tables to be replicated. If the database is quite large, then replication takes longer to complete. |
| **non-existing-db** | Make sure the provided database name in `Database` is correct, and that the database exists. |
| **The connection attempt failed / Connection to postgres:9999 refused** | Check to make sure that `hostname` and `port` are correct. |
| **Password authentication failed for user** | Make sure that the `User` and `Password` credentials are valid. |
| **The Plugin name value is invalid** | Make sure that `Plugin` contains a [valid value](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/postgresql.html#postgresql-property-plugin-name), either `decoderbufs` or `pgoutput`. |
| **Postgres server `wal_level` property is `replica`** | Specify `wal_level` as `logical` for your database. |
| **RecordTooLargeException: The message is 1050766 bytes when serialized, which is larger than 1048576, the value of the max.request.size configuration.** | Increase the max request size to unblock the connector and allow large messages to pass: ```"producer.override.max.request.size": "209715200".``` The connector may be reaching memory limits and failing if the amount of data to pass or your messages are too large. |
