To start sending data to the Redpanda cluster, you must configure the VPC network connection by connecting your Redpanda VPC to your existing AWS VPC.


### Prerequisites

* An AWS account 
* A running BYOC cluster in AWS. See [Create a BYOC Cluster on AWS](create-byoc-cluster-aws.mdx).
* Your Redpanda cluster and VPC must be in the same region.

## Create a peering connection 

1. In the AWS management console or the CLI, create a new peering connection between your AWS VPC and your Redpanda network using the following: 

    * VPC Requester: Your Redpanda VPC. This looks something like `network-ch2c2ntioepec6ilaoog`. 
    * VPC Accepter: Your existing AWS VPC ID.

    

2. After the VPC peering connection is created, make note of your peering connection ID. It has a `pcx-` prefix.

## Create routes from Redpanda to AWS

The following command routes traffic from Redpanda to AWS by finding the route tables for each associated subnet and creating a route: 

```
aws ec2 describe-route-tables --filter "Name=tag:Name,Values=network-<redpanda-cluster-id>" "Name=tag:purpose,Values=private" | jq -r '.RouteTables[].RouteTableId' | \ 
while read -r route_table_id; do \ 
aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id $route_table_id --destination-cidr-block <aws-vpc-cidr-block> --vpc-peering-connection-id <peering-connection-id>; \ 
done;
```

Replace the following placeholder values:

* Redpanda cluster ID: This is listed in the **Overview** page of your cluster. 
* AWS CIDR block: This is listed in the AWS UI **Details** for your VPC. 
* Peering connection ID: This is the ID of the peering connection noted in step one.  

## Create routes from AWS to Redpanda

Now you must route your AWS
subnet(s) to your Redpanda CIDR. The base command: 

```
aws ec2 --region <region> create-route \
  --route-table-id <aws-route-table-id> \
  --destination-cidr-block <redpanda-cidr-range> \
  --vpc-peering-connection-id <peering-connection-id>
```

Your VPC may have multiple subnets, which may have multiple route table associations. Add the route to all the subnets.

## Test your connection 

There are two ways to test your connection: 

* Return to your cluster overview, and follow the directions in the **How to connect** panel. 
* Use the AWS [Reachability Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/reachability/what-is-reachability-analyzer.html). Select your VM instance and a Redpanda instance as the source and destination, and test the connection between them.
