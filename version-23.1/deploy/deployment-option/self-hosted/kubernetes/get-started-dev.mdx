To start with a local development cluster and learn how Redpanda works in Kubernetes, see [Deploy a Local Development Cluster with kind or minikube](../local-guide).

For end-to-end guides on secure deployments of Redpanda on managed Kubernetes services, see:

- [Azure Kubernetes Service](../aks-guide) (AKS)
- [Elastic Kubernetes Service](../eks-guide) (EKS)
- [Google Kubernetes Engine](../gke-guide) (GKE)
- [Local (kind or minikube)](../kubernetes/local-guide.mdx)

Or, if you're ready to go into production, see the [production deployment workflow](../production-workflow).
