You can deploy Redpanda using well-known configuration properties optimized for a development or test environment. This configuration uses less system resources and simplifies setup, but it's not suitable for a production deployment. For example, in [development mode](../../../../../../reference/rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-mode/#development-mode), the default `group_topic_partitions` is 3, and the default `storage_min_free_bytes` is 1 GiB. In production mode, the default `group_topic_partitions` is 16, and the default `storage_min_free_bytes` is 5 GiB. 

:::info
- Development mode bypasses `fsync`, acknowledging messages before they're stored to disk. This reduces the durability of messages, could cause potential data loss, and could give unrealistic performance data for a production environment. 
- See [Deploy for Production](../../production/production-deployment) to deploy for a production environment. 
- See [Redpanda Quickstart](../../../../../../get-started/quick-start) to try out Redpanda in Docker.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware and software

The same prerequisites for a production environment are recommended for a development environment.

- Operating system
  - Minimum recommended version of RHEL of RHEL/CentOS: <Versions name="rhel"/>
  - Minimum version of Ubuntu: <Versions name="ubuntu"/>
- CPU and memory
  - A minimum of three physical nodes or virtual machines are required. 
  - Two physical (not virtual) cores are required. Four physical cores are strongly recommended.
  - x86_64 (Westmere or newer) and AWS Graviton family processors are supported.
- Storage
  - An XFS or ext4 file system for the data directory of Redpanda (`/var/lib/redpanda/data`) or the Tiered Storage cache. XFS is highly recommended. NFS is not supported.
  - Locally-attached NVMe devices. RAID-0 is required if you use multiple disks.
  - Ephemeral cloud instance storage is only recommended in combination with Tiered Storage or for Tiered Storage cache. Without Tiered Storage, attached persistent volumes (for example, EBS) are recommended.
- Object storage providers for Tiered Storage
  - Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
  - Google Cloud Storage (GCS), using the Google Cloud Platform S3 API
  - Azure Blob Storage (ABS)
- Networking
  - Minimum 10 GigE
- See [Manage Disk Space](../../../../../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization) for guidelines on cluster creation.

#### TCP/IP ports

Redpanda uses the following default ports:

| Port | Purpose |
|---|---|
|`9092`|Kafka API|
|`8082`|HTTP Proxy|
|`8081`|Schema Registry|
|`9644`|Admin API and Prometheus|
|`33145`|internal RPC|


## Install Redpanda

Install Redpanda on each system you want to be part of your cluster. There are binaries available for Fedora/RedHat or Debian systems.

You can also install Redpanda using an [Ansible playbook](../../production/production-deployment-automation).

## Install Redpanda Console

Redpanda Console is a developer-friendly web UI for managing and debugging your Redpanda cluster and your applications. Install Redpanda Console alongside a Redpanda cluster.

For each new release, Redpanda compiles the Redpanda Console to a single binary for Linux, macOS, and Windows. You can find the binaries in the attachments of each release on [GitHub](https://github.com/redpanda-data/console/releases).

## Start Redpanda

Configure Redpanda using the [`rpk redpanda config bootstrap`](../../../../../../reference/rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-config-bootstrap) command, then start Redpanda: 

```bash
sudo rpk redpanda config bootstrap --self <private-ip> --ips <seed-node-ips> && \
sudo rpk redpanda config set redpanda.empty_seed_starts_cluster false && \
sudo systemctl start redpanda
```

- The `--self` flag tells Redpanda the interface address to bind to. Usually this is its private IP.
- The `--ips` flag lists all the seed nodes in the cluster, including the one being started. Seed nodes correspond to the `seed_servers` property in `redpanda.yaml`. 

  :::note notes
  - The `--ips` flag must be set *identically* (with nodes listed in identical order) on each node.
  - Do not run `sudo rpk redpanda tune all` on development deployments.
  :::

When a Redpanda cluster starts, it instantiates a controller Raft group with all the seed nodes that are specified in the `--ips` flag. After all seed nodes complete their startup procedure and become accessible, the cluster is then available. After that, non-seed nodes start up and are added to the cluster.

:::info
- It's important to have one or more seed nodes in each fault domain (such as rack or cloud AZ). A higher number provides a stronger guarantee that clusters don’t fracture unintentionally.
- It's possible to change the seed nodes for a short period of time after a cluster has been created. For example, you may want to designate one additional broker as a seed node to increase availability. To do this without cluster downtime, add the new broker to [`seed_servers`](../../../../../../reference/node-properties/) and restart Redpanda to apply the change on a broker-by-broker basis.
- If firewall ports block the internal RPC port `33145`, then the non-seed nodes could take time to fail. If that happens, run `sudo systemctl stop redpanda` (or `yum remove redpanda` or `apt-get remove redpanda`), fix the firewall issue, and then start Redpanda again.
:::

## Start Redpanda Console

1. Start Redpanda Console:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start redpanda-console
  ```

1. Make sure that Redpanda Console is active and running:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status redpanda-console
  ```

## Verify the installation

To verify that the Redpanda cluster is up and running, use `rpk` to get information about the cluster:

```bash
rpk cluster info
```


To create a topic:

```bash
rpk topic create panda
```
