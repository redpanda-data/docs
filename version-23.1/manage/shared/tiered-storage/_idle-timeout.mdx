You can configure Redpanda to start a remote write periodically. This is useful if the ingestion rate is low and the segments are kept open for long periods of time. You specify a number of seconds for the timeout, and if that time has passed since the previous write and the partition has new data, Redpanda starts a new write. This limits data loss in the event of catastrophic failure and adds a guarantee that you only lose the specified number of seconds of data.

Setting idle timeout to a very short interval can create a lot of small files, which can affect throughput. If you decide to set a value for idle timeout, start with 600 seconds, which prevents the creation of so many small files that throughput is affected when you recover the files.

Use the <TunableClusterProperty name="cloud_storage_segment_max_upload_interval_sec" frontmatter={props.frontmatter}/> property to set the number of seconds for idle timeout. If this property is empty, Redpanda uploads metadata to object storage, but the segment is not uploaded until it reaches the `segment.bytes` size. By default, the property is null.
