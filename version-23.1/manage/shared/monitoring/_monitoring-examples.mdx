For hands-on learning, Redpanda provides a repository with examples of monitoring Redpanda with Prometheus and Grafana: [redpanda-data/observability](https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability).

[![Example Redpanda Ops Dashboard](https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability/blob/main/docs/images/Ops%20Dashboard.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability)

It includes [example Grafana dashboards](https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability#grafana-dashboards) and a [sandbox environment](https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability#sandbox-environment) in which you launch a Dockerized Redpanda cluster and create a custom workload to monitor with dashboards.
