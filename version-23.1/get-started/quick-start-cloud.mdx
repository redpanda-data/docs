Spin up a Redpanda cluster with Redpanda Cloud, create a basic streaming application using the rpk command-line tool, and explore your cluster in Redpanda Console.

Redpanda Cloud is a fully managed Redpanda cluster hosted on dedicated resources and configurable instance types.

## Prerequisites

[Sign up for a trial](https://redpanda.com/try-redpanda?section=cloud-trial) of Redpanda Cloud - Dedicated Clusters.

## Deploy Redpanda

To deploy a Redpanda cluster in the Dedicated cloud, create a namespace, then follow the steps for creating a Dedicated cluster.

To create a namespace:

<CreateNamespace/>

To create a cluster:

1. Click **Add Cluster**.

1. Click **Create Dedicated cluster**, and enter the following values:

    - **Cluster name**:

      ```
      redpandaquickstart
      ```

    - **Throughput**: 1 MBps

    - **Version**: Choose the latest available version

1. Click **Next** to see the **Cloud settings** options, and enter the following values:

    - **Provider**: AWS

    - **Region**: Any region that's closest to you

    - **Availability**: Single AZ

    - **Select a zone**: Choose any zone

1. Click **Next** to see the **Networking** options, and enter the following values:

    - **Connection Type**: Public Network

1. Click **Create**.

1. Wait for both your network and your cluster to be created.

## Start streaming

To start building a basic streaming application, you can use rpk to create a topic, produce messages to it, and consume messages from it.
rpk is a command-line tool for connecting to and interacting with Redpanda brokers.

1. Install rpk on your local machine:

  :::note
  The `rpk` binary is not supported on Windows.
  :::

1. On the **Overview** page of Redpanda Cloud, copy your bootstrap server address and set it as an environment variable on your local machine:

  ```bash
  export REDPANDA_BROKERS="<bootstrap-server-address>"
  ```

1. In Redpanda Cloud, go to **Security** and create a user called **redpanda-chat-account** that uses the SCRAM-SHA-256 mechanism.

1. Copy the password, and set the following environment variables on your local machine:

  ```bash
  export REDPANDA_SASL_USERNAME="redpanda-chat-account"
  export REDPANDA_SASL_PASSWORD="<password>"
  export REDPANDA_SASL_MECHANISM="SCRAM-SHA-256"
  ```

1. In Redpanda Cloud, click the name of your user and add the following permissions to the ACL (access control list):

    - **Host**: *
    - **Topic name**:

      ```
      chat-room
      ```

    - **Operations**: All

1. Use rpk on your local machine to authenticate to Redpanda as the redpanda-chat-account user and get information about the cluster:

  ```bash
  rpk cluster info --tls-enabled
  ```

1. Create a topic called `chat-room`.

  You granted permissions to the **redpanda-chat-account** user to access only this topic.

  ```bash
  rpk topic create chat-room --tls-enabled
  ```

  Output:

  ```bash
  TOPIC       STATUS
  chat-room  OK
  ```

1. Produce a message to the topic:

  ```bash
  rpk topic produce chat-room --tls-enabled
  ```

1. Enter a message, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>:

  ```text
  Pandas are fabulous!
  ```

  Example output:

  ```text
  Produced to partition 0 at offset 0 with timestamp 1663282629789.
  ```

1. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to finish producing messages to the topic.

1. Consume one message from the topic:

  ```bash
  rpk topic consume chat-room --num 1 --tls-enabled
  ```

  Your message is displayed along with its metadata,:

  ```json
  {
    "topic": "chat-room",
    "value": "Pandas are fabulous!",
    "timestamp": 1663282629789,
    "partition": 0,
    "offset": 0
  }
  ```

## Explore your topic

In Redpanda Cloud, go to **Topics** > **chat-room**.

The message that you produced to the topic is displayed along with some other details about the topic.

## Clean up

If you don't want to continue experimenting with your cluster, you can delete it.

Go to **Cluster settings** and click **Delete cluster**.
