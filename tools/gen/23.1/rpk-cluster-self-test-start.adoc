= rpk cluster self-test start
:description: rpk cluster self-test start

Starts one or more benchmark tests on one or more nodes
of the cluster. Available tests to run:

* Disk tests:
  * Throughput test: 512 KB messages, sequential read/write
    * Uses a larger request message sizes and deeper I/O queue depth to write/read more bytes in a shorter amount of time, at the cost of IOPS/latency.
  * Latency test: 4 KB messages, sequential read/write
    * Uses smaller request message sizes and lower levels of parallelism to achieve higher IOPS and lower latency.

* Network tests:
  * Throughput test: 8192-bit messages
    * Unique pairs of Redpanda nodes each act as a client and a server.
    * The test pushes as much data over the wire, within the test parameters.

This command immediately returns on success, and the tests run asynchronously. The
user polls for results with the 'self-test status'
command.
