= rpk topic list
:description: rpk topic list

List topics, optionally listing specific topics.

This command lists all topics that you have access to by default. If specifying
topics or regular expressions, this command can be used to know exactly what
topics you would delete if using the same input to the delete command.

Alternatively, you can request specific topics to list, which can be used to
check authentication errors (do you not have access to a topic you were
expecting to see?), or to list all topics that match regular expressions.

The --regex flag (-r) opts into parsing the input topics as regular expressions
and listing any non-internal topic that matches any of expressions. The input
expressions are wrapped with ^ and $ so that the expression must match the
whole topic name. Regular expressions cannot be used to match internal topics,
as such, specifying both -i and -r will exit with failure.

Lastly, --detailed flag (-d) opts in to printing extra per-partition
information.
