= rpk cloud auth delete
:description: rpk cloud auth delete

Delete an rpk cloud auth.

Deleting a cloud auth removes it from the rpk.yaml file. If the deleted
auth was the current auth, rpk will use a default SSO auth the next time
you try to login and save that auth.

If you delete an auth that is used by profiles, affected profiles have
their auth cleared and you will only be able to access the profile's
cluster via SASL credentials.

== Usage
