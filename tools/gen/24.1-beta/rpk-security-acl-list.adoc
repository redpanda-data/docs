= rpk security acl list
:description: rpk security acl list

List ACLs.

See the 'rpk acl' help text for a full write up on ACLs. List flags work in a
similar multiplying effect as creating ACLs, but list is more advanced:
listing works on a filter basis. Any unspecified flag defaults to matching
everything (all operations, or all allowed principals, etc).

As mentioned, not specifying flags matches everything. If no resources are
specified, all resources are matched. If no operations are specified, all
operations are matched. You can also opt in to matching everything with "any":
--operation any matches any operation.

The --resource-pattern-type, defaulting to "any", configures how to filter
resource names:
  * "any" returns exact name matches of either prefixed or literal pattern type
  * "match" returns wildcard matches, prefix patterns that match your input, and literal matches
  * "prefix" returns prefix patterns that match your input (prefix "fo" matches "foo")
  * "literal" returns exact name matches
