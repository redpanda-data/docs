= rpk transform list
:description: rpk transform list

List data transforms.

This command lists all data transforms in a cluster, as well as showing the
state of a individual transform processor, such as if it's errored or how many
records are pending to be processed (lag).

There is a processor assigned to each partition on the input topic, and each
processor is a separate entity that can make progress or fail independently.

The --detailed flag (-d) opts in to printing extra per-processor information.
