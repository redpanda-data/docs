= rpk debug bundle
:description: rpk debug bundle

'rpk debug bundle' collects environment data that can help debug and diagnose
issues with a redpanda cluster, a broker, or the machine it's running on. It
then bundles the collected data into a ZIP file, called a diagnostics bundle.

The files and directories in the diagnostics bundle differ depending on the 
environment in which Redpanda is running:

COMMON FILES

 - Kafka metadata: Broker configs, topic configs, start/committed/end offsets,
   groups, group commits.

 - Controller logs: The controller logs directory up to a limit set by
   --controller-logs-size-limit flag

 - Data directory structure: A file describing the data directory's contents.

 - Redpanda configuration: The redpanda configuration file (`redpanda.yaml`;
   SASL credentials are stripped).

 - Runtime system information (/proc): Process information, by reading /proc 
  files like core count, cache, frequency, interrupts, mounted file systems, 
  memory usage, kernel command line.

 - Resource usage data: CPU usage percentage, free memory available for the
   redpanda process.

 - Clock drift: The ntp clock delta (using pool.ntp.org as a reference) & round
   trip time.

 - Admin API calls: Multiple requests to gather information such as: Cluster and
   broker configurations, cluster health data, balancer status, cloud storage
   status, and license key information.

 - Broker metrics: The broker's Prometheus metrics, fetched through its
   admin API (/metrics and /public_metrics).

BARE-METAL

 - Kernel: The kernel logs ring buffer (syslog) and parameters (sysctl).

 - DNS: The DNS info as reported by 'dig', using the hosts in
   /etc/resolv.conf.

 - Disk usage: The disk usage for the data directory, as output by 'du'.

 - redpanda logs: The node's redpanda logs written to journald. If --logs-since 
   or --logs-until are passed, then only the logs within the resulting time frame
   will be included.

 - Socket info: The active sockets data output by 'ss'.

 - Running process info: As reported by 'top'.

 - Virtual memory stats: As reported by 'vmstat'.

 - Network config: As reported by 'ip addr'.

 - lspci: List the PCI buses and the devices connected to them.

 - dmidecode: The DMI table contents. Only included if this command is run
   as root.

KUBERNETES

 - Kubernetes Resources: Kubernetes manifests for all resources in the given 
   Kubernetes namespace (via --namespace).

 - redpanda logs: Logs of each Pod in the the given Kubernetes namespace. If 
   --logs-since is passed, only the logs within the given timeframe are 
   included.

EXTRA REQUESTS FOR PARTITIONS

You can provide a list of partitions to save additional admin API requests
specifically for those partitions.

The partition flag accepts the format {namespace}/[topic]/[partitions...]
where the namespace is optional, if the namespace is not provided, rpk will 
assume 'kafka'. For example:

Topic 'foo', partitions 1, 2 and 3:
  --partitions foo/1,2,3

Namespace _redpanda-internal, topic 'bar', partition 2
  --partitions _redpanda-internal/bar/2

If you have an upload URL from the Redpanda support team, provide it in the 
--upload-url flag to upload your diagnostics bundle to Redpanda.
