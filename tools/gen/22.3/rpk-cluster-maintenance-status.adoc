   1        false     false     false   0           0         0             0

Field descriptions:

        NODE-ID: the node ID
       DRAINING: true if the node is actively draining leadership
       FINISHED: leadership draining has completed
         ERRORS: errors have been encountered while draining
     PARTITIONS: number of partitions whose leadership has moved
       ELIGIBLE: number of partitions with leadership eligible to move
   TRANSFERRING: current active number of leadership transfers
         FAILED: number of failed leadership transfers

Notes:

   - When errors are present further information will be available in the logs
     for the corresponding node.
