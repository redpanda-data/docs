= rpk debug bundle
:description: rpk debug bundle

'rpk debug bundle' collects environment data that can help debug and diagnose
issues with a redpanda cluster, a broker, or the machine it's running on. It
then bundles the collected data into a zip file.

The following are the data sources that are bundled in the compressed file:

 - Kafka metadata: Broker configs, topic configs, start/committed/end offsets,
   groups, group commits.

 - Data directory structure: A file describing the data directory's contents.

 - redpanda configuration: The redpanda configuration file (`redpanda.yaml`;
   SASL credentials are stripped).

 - /proc/cpuinfo: CPU information like make, core count, cache, frequency.

 - /proc/interrupts: IRQ distribution across CPU cores.

 - Resource usage data: CPU usage percentage, free memory available for the
   redpanda process.

 - Clock drift: The ntp clock delta (using pool.ntp.org as a reference) & round
   trip time.

 - Kernel logs: The kernel logs ring buffer (syslog).

 - Broker metrics: The local broker's Prometheus metrics, fetched through its
   admin API.

 - DNS: The DNS info as reported by 'dig', using the hosts in
   /etc/resolv.conf.

 - Disk usage: The disk usage for the data directory, as output by 'du'.

 - redpanda logs: The redpanda logs written to journald. If --logs-since or
   --logs-until are passed, then only the logs within the resulting time frame
   will be included.

 - Socket info: The active sockets data output by 'ss'.

 - Running process info: As reported by 'top'.

 - Virtual memory stats: As reported by 'vmstat'.

 - Network config: As reported by 'ip addr'.

 - lspci: List the PCI buses and the devices connected to them.

 - dmidecode: The DMI table contents. Only included if this command is run
   as root.
