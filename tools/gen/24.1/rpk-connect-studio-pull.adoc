:description: rpk connect studio pull

NAME:
   /opt/redpanda/bin/.rpk.ac-connect studio pull - Run deployments configured within a Benthos Studio session

USAGE:
   /opt/redpanda/bin/.rpk.ac-connect studio pull [command options] [arguments...]

DESCRIPTION:
   When a Studio session has one or more deployments added this command will
   synchronise with the session and obtain a deployment assignment. The assigned
   deployment will then determine which configs from the session to download and
   execute.

   When either changes are made to files of an assigned deployment, or when a new
   deployment is assigned, this service will automatically download the new config
   files and execute them, replacing the previous stream running.

OPTIONS:
   --session value, -s value  The session ID to synchronise with.
   --name value               An explicit name to adopt in this instance, used to identify its connection to the session. Each running node must have a unique name, if left unset a name is generated each time the command is run.
   --token value              A token for the session, used to authenticate requests. If left blank the environment variable BSTDIO_NODE_TOKEN will be used instead.
   --token-secret value       A token secret the session, used to authenticate requests. If left blank the environment variable BSTDIO_NODE_SECRET will be used instead.
   --send-traces              Whether to send trace data back to Studio during execution. This is opt-in and is used as a way to add trace events to the graph editor for testing and debugging configs. This is a very useful feature but should be used with caution as it exports information about messages passing through the stream. (default: false)
   --help, -h                 show help
